Wash the Basmati rice and soak for 20 minutes. <br>2. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add salt and water. Add the soaked Basmati rice and cook for 5 minutes.<br>3. Strain the rice and spread it on a plate or tray. Allow it to cool. This prevents the rice from sticking to each other. <br>4. In a bowl, combine the chicken, soy sauce, black pepper powder and cornstarch. <br>5. Heat a wok and add 1 tbsp of oil. Add the eggs along with a pinch of salt. Scramble it and remove it from the pan. <br>6. Add 3 tbsp of oil and add the chicken, leaving space between each piece. Cook it for 3 minutes and remove it from the pan. <br>7. In the same pan, add the garlic, ginger and scallions. Saute and then add the cabbage, carrot and beans. Add sugar and saute for 1 minute on high heat. <br>8. Add white pepper powder, soy sauce and chilli sauce. Mix well. <br>9. Add the cooked rice, eggs and chicken. Toss until evenly combined. Add 1 tsp of salt. <br>10. Allow it to cook for 2 minutes, tossing occasionally. <br>11. Add the spring onions, toss and remove from the heat. <br><br>Cooking Tips:<br>1. You can cook the rice up to a day in advance, spread it out onto a flat tray and store it in the refrigerator. You can use it directly for the fried rice later. This is the method used by most restaurants and gives the ideal texture for the rice. <br>2. The level of salt might differ according to the brand and type of soya sauce used. Taste the rice after adding all the sauces, and then add in the salt for an accurate taste.', 'I think it is yummy 😋', 'Very nice video, very well explained and it looks really tasty and delicious!

7vqfjBZ9864;b'London Travel Guide for 2024 - All You Need To Know';b'Headout';"London, the capital of England, is the largest
city in the United Kingdom with over 8 million people. Being a major cultural centre, London is home
to many of the world's most famous museums and art galleries. Over 30 million tourists come to London every
year to see its famous landmarks, such as Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and Westminster
Abbey. London is also home to The West End, a theatre
district known for its world-famous theatres like the Royal Opera House, Globe Theatre
and the Sondheim Theatre. In this London City Guide, we'll go over the
finest things to do during your stay, as well as ideas for organizing your visit to the
city known as ""The Big Smoke."" From cold cloudy weather conditions to bright
sunny ones, London manages to find its charm in everyone! However, generally speaking, London begins
to warm up in April and May. These months are perfect to visit London,
as the city begins to bloom. This is also a great month to visit if you
want to avoid big crowds, as many people haven’t started their summer vacations yet. June is great for the ones who love spending
time outdoors. The weather is warm and sunny, making it perfect
for exploring the city’s parks and green spaces. July and August is when London sees peak season,
as flocks of tourists visit the city in the summer. However, if you’re on a budget, November
and February are perfect! All flights to London land at one of six international
airports, the major one being Heathrow Airport. Once you’ve arrived at Heathrow, there are
a few different ways to get into the centre of London. If speed is your priority, then your best
bet is to take the train. The Heathrow Express is a direct service that
runs every 15 minutes to the city centre. If you’re looking to save some money, then
you can take the London Underground (also known as the Tube). There are so many things to see and do in
London that it can be difficult to know where to start. However, there are certain attractions that
should not be missed on your trip. Starting off with the mighty London Eye, Europe's
tallest cantilevered observation wheel by the River Thames, and arguably the most famous
clock in the world, the Big Ben. Other iconic structures that should definitely
make their way into your itinerary are the Buckingham Palace, Tower of London, Westminster
Abbey, Royal Observatory, and St Paul’s Cathedral. Also be sure to visit the Warner Bros Studio,
Hyde Park, and the National Gallery. When you think of London, the first thing
that springs to mind is a plethora of famous and historical places. The city is packed with well-known structures
and streets where some of history's most famous moments have occurred. From the busiest shopping street in Europe
with over 300 different shops, the Oxford Street, to the brightly neon-lit streets of
Piccadilly Circus that display an array of cinemas, theatres, and traditional English
Pubs. The streets of London absolutely have it all! Be sure to also visit Trafalgar Square and
a particular street in Central London that will be forever remembered thanks to the Beatles,
Abbey Road. The uniqueness of London is that, rather than
being one massive city, it feels like a collection of little neighbourhoods with its own flavour,
quirkiness, and personality. If you're looking to have some fun with great
food and drinks, Soho is the spot for you! For a full Soho experience, get tickets to
a West End show, and march up and down Old Compton Street and the surrounding area for
drinks! For an area full of music venues and pubs
then be sure to visit Camden. Experience an """"out of London"""" day trip at
the Greenwich and laze at the massive park all day, and take a walk around Kensington
to soak in all the beauty of some of the greatest museums in the world! There are a few areas that stand out as the
best places to stay in London. Central London is always going to be a great
option, as it puts you right in the heart of all the action. If you want to be close to the sights and
attractions, then this is definitely the place to be. Another great option is Kensington. This area is full of great shops, restaurants,
and cafes, as well as being close to some of London's most famous museums. If you're looking for a more affordable place
to stay in London, there are a few options that are worth considering. One of the most popular choices is Earl's
Court. This area is well connected to the rest of
London, and it has a great selection of restaurants, bars, and shops. Another budget-friendly option is Brixton. There's no better way to see London than by
foot. Walking around London is a great way to explore
the city's many different neighbourhoods, get a feel for its unique atmosphere, and
find some hidden gems along the way. London boasts an extensive bus network, with
over 700 routes criss-crossing the city. You can also make use of the London Underground,
which is an efficient and cheap way to get around. The city is served by a vast train network,
which is operated by a number of different companies, or you can use the Trams to travel
around, especially if you’re in South London. The Oyster card can be used to pay for all
public transport services. You also have the famous black cabs of London,
a quick and efficient way to get around the city without the hassle of changing trains
and waiting at the stations. Hail one on the streets and they'll drop you
at any corner of the city. When it comes to food, London is a city that
really has it all. There's something for everyone, regardless
of your preferences or budget. There's no better way to start the day than
with a cup of tea and the iconic English Breakfast. Pair that with a side of Scotch Eggs for a
proper British breakfast experience. For Lunch, indulge yourself in a traditional
British meal that's typically served on Sundays, the Sunday Roast! Pair that with England's most loved pasta,
Spaghetti Bolognese! If you want the true taste of an English bar,
don't forget to club your tapped beer with a side of Fish and Chips. And for all the cold nights, dive into a delicious,
piping hot plate of Chicken Tikka Masala with a bread of your choice! The cheapest time to travel to London is during
the off-season, from November to early March. With a little bit of planning and research,
you can easily enjoy London on a budget of 50-60 Pounds a day. From free museums and attractions to discounted
tickets for shows and events, there are plenty of ways to save money while still enjoying
all that the city has to offer. You can also visit many of London's iconic
landmarks free of costs, such as Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, and Piccadilly Circus. If you purchase an Oyster card, which gives
you access to the city's buses, trains, and subways for a predetermined daily cost, you
can save money on transportation in London. But you can always ditch the public transport
and walk about town! With so much to see and do in London, many
visitors never venture beyond its limits. If you're looking for a change of pace from
the hustle and bustle of London, plan a day trip to the scenic outskirts of London such
as the Windsor Castle, Stonehenge, Brighton, and White Cliffs of Dover. Other popular day trip destinations include
the beach towns in Kent, the historic city of Bath, the beautiful countrysides of the
Cotswolds and the university towns of Oxford and Cambridge. While visiting London, it's important to pack
either an umbrella or a raincoat and a pair of water-resistant shoes. You can never predict the kind of weather
in London! During the winter months, make sure you carry
thick coats because the temperature can go as low as 2 C. If you want to keep up with
London's classic look, you can pack yourself a Trench coat. For first-time visitors, we recommend spending
at least four or five days in London to allow you time to get a feel for the city and see
many of its major attractions. If you're visiting London, you can use Headout
to plan your entire holiday. Visit headout.com to see our comprehensive
offering of itineraries, experiences, activities, and trips that showcase London's top sights. We offer everything from Harry Potter Tours
to the Thames River cruises and even day trips to picturesque regions of London. If you'd like to learn more about London and

Make sure they get it working. Really helps in navigating, deciphering menus and staying connected with the internet. Otherwise I agree on the tuna mayonnaise rice balls and the hot springs! Getting PASE0 card for the trains and busses a must. One more thing in most onsen there is a tattoo verbot , that is you’re not allowed in with tattoos. It’s another Japanese cultural quirk.', 'Onsen is one of the best things about Japan. I only went to onsen once but had a bath every night I could. So relaxing', 'Wow!! Antonin, Great job!

wlKic6yTUUs;b'Dubai Travel Guide - 15 Experiences YOU MUST DO in 2023';b'Ian and Ana';Habibi come to Dubai hey guys we're Ian and Anna and we just spent the last two weeks in the incredible futuristic city of Dubai in this video we want to share with you our top 15 favorite things to do in this city let's start off with number 15 Miracle Garden this three-time Guinness World Record breaker is filled with 150 million flowers and is the perfect place for not only flower lovers but also children you'll notice just how family friendly it is when you initially walk in and are greeted by two Immaculate shrub stallions that serve as a gate to the rest of the Majestic Garden there's endless fun things to see including a Smurf Village a flower princess floating above her castle and the world's biggest floral installation which is that life-sized replica of the Emirates airplane as I'm sure you know Dubai gets pretty hot so we recommend coming as soon as it opens at 9am you only need to spend one to two hours to see everything you want and if you have some extra time you can head over to the world's largest butterfly garden that holds 15 000 butterflies coming up is number 14 Dubai Mall the Dubai Mall is the largest mall in the world and is roughly the size of 200 football fields it has more than 1200 stores with every brand you could possibly think of in around 200 restaurants you could definitely open entire day here especially because it's connected to the Burj Khalifa and right outside its doors is the famous water show other mind-blowing things you could find here is an Olympic-sized ice skating rink the world's largest indoor aquarium and even 150 million year old dinosaur which was discovered in Wyoming if you're not a fan of crowds avoid this area at all costs because it gets around 75 million visitors a year and can feel quite claustrophobic next up is number 14 the iconic Burj Khalifa since 2009 the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest building in the world at 828 meters high it's equivalent to the size of three Eiffel Towers or two empire state buildings it cost a whopping 1.5 billion dollars to complete this structure there's 160 floors and you can ride all the way to 154 to visit the highest outdoor observation deck in the world don't worry there's glass surrounding it so you won't fall off I don't think people realize just how big this building is if you're standing at its base you have to crank your head all the way back just to see the tip of it and why you turn it sideways so they can see like how it doesn't even fit in the frame oh my God the building's exterior contains 26 000 glass panels and I know what you're thinking how do they keep it so clean while they hire 120 glass cleaners and it takes them three months to clean the entire building and of course while you're there just outside the Burj Khalifa you can see the world's largest water show the Dubai Fountain was designed by a california-based company also responsible for the creation of the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas it was so cool taking in the water show from above on the observation deck and then seeing it again from the ground floor The Fountains dance every 30 minutes starting at 6 PM the bird lights up in the background and is truly a sight to see apparently this spot is also very cool at New Year's when there are fireworks shooting from the building combined with a truly Sensational water show next we have number 12 Museum of the future this has to be one of the coolest buildings we've ever seen and it makes sense because its nickname is the most beautiful building on earth the symbolism behind it though makes it even more impressive the building's circular form represents Humanity the green Mound it sits on represents the earth and the void in the middle represents our unknown future wrapping the outside of the windows are three quotes from Sheikh Mohammed who is the prime minister of the UAE and the ruler of Dubai and these quotes in Arabic are his thoughts and vision for the city's future the Museum of the future officially opened to the public in 2022 so it's brand new and that's why we couldn't even get a ticket to enter we highly recommend you book online before arriving so we'll make sure to put a link in the description below inside you can expect to see the future of space travel robots Innovation and sustainability even if you can't enter the museum you can still check out the lobby which looks like you're walking into the future it's an all-white room with spiral staircases mesmerizing elevators and a ceiling that glows up with more Arabic quotes personally the best time to visit is at Sunset and when it gets dark this entire structure glows in the night with the city shining all around it up next is number 11 The Unbelievable Palm Jumeirah there are three man-made islands off the coast of Dubai but the biggest and most famous is the Palm Jumeirah this palm trees shaped island stretches five kilometers into the Arabian Gulf and it's so massive that you can see it from space to create this they blasted 7 million tons of rock from a nearby mountain and dug up sand below the Persian Gulf it costs 12 billion dollars and took six years to build the famous Atlantis stands at the front of the palm and here you can have a full day of fun at the water park which broke the world record for most water slides we actually did spend a day here and it was an absolute blast I think if you have kids this is the perfect spot to get some of their energy out definitely visit the Tower of Neptune first to go on the leap of faith Atlantis most famous water slide if you're an adrenaline junkie and want to go skydiving I don't know of many other places that you can skydive with a view like this one this is actually the only way to see the Palm from above other than taking a helicopter ride let us know in the comments below if you've gone skydiving in Dubai because we would love to hear your opinion let's move on to number 10. rooftop bars and pools Dubai is all about that go big or go home mentality and they definitely didn't skimp out on rooftop pools and bars of course Dubai holds two more records first it has the world's highest infinity pool and second it has the world's highest 360 degree infinity pool called Aura sky pool the one we really wanted to visit was the aura sky pool but of course it was booked out for two weeks when we were there so please make sure to book reservations far in advance if you like to drink alcohol with city views we have heard great things about level 43 Sky Lounge which is located on the roof of the Sheraton Hotel this Sky Lounge overlooks Sheikh Zaid Highway which is this famous road that connects all seven Emirates in the UAE it has an astounding 14 lanes and during your time in Dubai you will definitely spot supercars flying down this highway now on to number nine the Dubai frame so be completely honest with you guys at first I thought the concept of a gold-plated giant picture frame in the middle of the city was a little odd I kind of didn't want to go but then I found out what it symbolized the Dubai frame represents a connection between both the past and the present in this rapidly changing City when you're at the top of the building on one side you'll see old Dubai where everything began and on your other side you're going to be seeing the most futuristic city in the world that has just been built in the last 40 years time when you walk outside that elevator the floors are actually censored so when you step on them they turn clear and you can see all the way to the ground below you even gave us a pretty good Adrenaline Rush stepping on those floors coming up we have number eight Dune buggying a trip to Dubai is not complete without visiting the sand dunes surrounding the city we went on a safari tour that we'll talk about later in the video but right now is all about dune buggy we ended up choosing the cheapest one hour tour that we could find which was 156 dollars total for two people that means each driver will get around 30 minutes behind the wheel which was more than enough time for us for our tour we decided to get up bright and early one morning at 7 A.M and head one hour to the sand dunes which was the best decision not only is it less hot but we had the entire tour to ourselves because no one wanted to get up that early just so you know in Dubai it's a law that you need a tour guide to lead you around the sand dunes and at first I was super disappointed especially because it started out really slow basically at the beginning the guide wants to feel out your driving skills and once you are more confident he definitely lets you go much faster just in case the tour companies run out of helmets with face masks make sure to bring sunglasses so the sand doesn't spray in your face the whole time whizzing up and down the sand dunes is not only thrilling but hilarious because as the passenger you never really know what your partner is going to do there are endless kinds of tour companies for everyone's budget and with different high-speed dune buggies I'll make sure to link a couple below for you guys next up is number seven Hell's Kitchen now if you haven't seen the short we posted on this you should go watch it ASAP you'll really understand my love for all things Gordon Ramsay if you don't know what house kitchen is it's a restaurant inspired from Gordon Ramsay's famous TV show Hell's Kitchen we've had the pleasure of eating at HK at Caesar's Palace in Vegas and it was so good any chance we get to eat at it again we take the opportunity oddly enough this is his only Hell's Kitchen restaurant outside of the US everything is designed just like the TV show where there's a red and blue team and they cook right in front of you our highly recommended dishes to you would be the brata salad followed by Gordon's famous Beef Wellington which is so freaking delicious you have to get it best dessert we've ever had in our life the famous sticky toffee pudding oh my mouth is watering just thinking about it moving on to number six food tour let's be honest food is the best part of travel and that's why in every place we visit around the world we always start our time with a local food tour you not only get to try some of the best food during your trip but you also get to make friends with locals that will teach you all about the culture we met our tour guide Sandy in Dara which is the heart of Dubai's Old Town here we stroll through the Maze of narrow Alleyways passing by classic Sandstone buildings and trying all sorts of dishes like camel gelato Falafel pitas chicken shawarma and much more then it was time to pass through the golden spice souks where there are mounds of colorful spices and more gold than we've seen in our lives lastly we crossed the Dubai Creek on traditional boats to visit burdubai and have delicious messy platters and some fresh squeezed orange juice throughout our experience Sandy was begging us to try the camel Burger but Anna had zero interest because that's her favorite animal of course I'm willing to try a bite of just about anything so Sandy brought us the most famous spot for Camel bear to be honest I felt guilty the entire time because in this restaurant you are surrounded by tons of cute camel artwork and wallpaper visiting the old town of Dubai was such a breath of fresh air especially when you're surrounded by skyscrapers all day now let's move on to number five jet skiing although you can jet ski anywhere in the world there are very few places that offer as epic of a Skyline as jet skiing in Dubai does within one hour we were able to see the Burj al-arab the Atlantis and the mass of Dubai Skyline with a Burj Khalifa in it we booked a one-hour session in the morning and let me tell you I don't think it was enough we recommend going in the morning at 9am not only is it a great way to wake up but the waves are the calmest at that time even though Sunset sounds like it would be nice and fun the water gets super choppy and it's way more crowded which allows you less room to go wild either way you can't get too wild because it's a requirement in Dubai to jet ski with a tour guide but our guy was super chill and Ian reached 70 miles per hour on his jet ski so they're not extremely restrictive quick announcement this entire trip and video would not be possible without our sponsor get your guide get your guide is a platform with over 65 000 experiences worldwide everything you've seen this video was booked through their app they offer tour guides experiences entrance fee tickets and even skip the line opportunities just like the Burj Khalifa We got to skip the entire massive line there and they also let you cancel 24 hours before your tour starts and you get all your money back everything will be linked down in the description below and we get a small little Kickback so we can keep creating travel guys just like this one next up number four Dubai Marina and beaches Dubai is probably one of the most well-rounded cities in the world you have world record breakers for pretty much any category beautiful architecture old and new deserts and more fun than you could feel in a lifetime but to have all this and be right next to the Persian Gulf with amazing beaches you really can't beat it now when visiting Dubai you'll probably stay in one of two locations either in the city center close to the Burj Khalifa or 25 minutes down the road near Dubai Marina during our two weeks in Dubai we split up our time and stayed seven days downtown and seven days in the Dubai Marina and honestly if we can go back I would have spent more time near the marina there's just nothing like having a hundred dollar Airbnb a five minute walk from the beach there are plenty of beaches lining up the coast but we visited the most popular called jbr Beach right near the marina even though it's super crowded it was the best spot to take in the sunset watch Yachts Roll by and even see the largest ferris wheel in the world which was inspired by the London Eye another fun thing you could do at the marina is take dinner cruises up and down the coast at night which would be such a relaxing way to see different perspectives of Dubai next up is number three Deep dive Dubai Deep dive Dubai is another world record-breaking facility allowing Thrill Seekers to dive into another dimension this is the deepest pool in the world at 60 meters deep but it's so much more than a pool it's basically like exploring a sunken city it seems like there are so many rooms and crevices filled with unique things to do there's even a game room where you can play foosball or chess that is like all my favorite things combined in one place deep dive Dubai is the one thing I really really wanted to do unfortunately it's a bit expensive and it was all booked up while we were there all the more reason to visit again though next up number two Abu Dhabi even though this one isn't located in Dubai and Abu Dhabi day trip is a must do Abu Dhabi is the largest Emirate and also the capital city of the UAE if Dubai is the financial and tourism Hub then Abu Dhabi is the oil capital and that's because 96 of the country's oil is found in this one Emirate right now to visit Abu Dhabi you need a kova test but most tour companies will help you set one up at your hotel beforehand after driving an hour and a half from Dubai to Abu Dhabi you can first stop at the Louvre Museum if you haven't noticed Dubai likes to copycat a lot of famous landmarks around the world and they went over the top for the Louvre just for the name itself the UAE paid France 500 million dollars for a 30-year contract although this museum has a bunch of cool art it's nothing compared to the galleries in Paris but the real thing to be excited about here is this spectacular architecture this massive floating Dome on top of an all-white building contrast perfectly with the surrounding blue water what's really cool about the Dome is that it has eight different layers which creates this rain of light effect coming through as you're walking around after Lube you can visit many more places like the Emirates Palace which is now turned into a hotel that you could stay at and then you could hop right over to the presidential Palace where all the government meetings are held now one of the main reasons you're probably wanting to visit Abu Dhabi is for the Grand Mosque which is the ninth largest mosque in the world and can fit upwards of 40 000 worshipers at once this was by far the prettiest Moss we've ever been to especially because it's all white marble walking around I couldn't believe my eyes because it was just perfection keep in mind there is a dress code here where men have to cover their shoulders and knees and women have to cover pretty much everything besides their face thankfully our tour guide was nice enough to bring an extra Abaya which is a traditional outfit of amarati women another thing to keep in mind is that this is a place of worship so please be respectful the security guards do not want you touching each other in photos giving peace signs or basically any movement other than smiling now coming in at number one 1. the Safari tour a safari tour is something everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime when you leave the city and approach the desert you really get to see what a local Bedouin lived like Bedouins are nomadic Arab tribes who have historically inhibited the desert regions although there aren't many Native Bedouins left in the UAE their Traditions are passed down and celebrated with visitors if you have a layover or just a short amount of time in Dubai you should definitely book a desert Safari tour here's everything that's included first you'll get picked up from your accommodation it's about an hour drive to the desert and the first thing offered is camel riding although we skipped with camel riding we did get to say hi to some baby camels after all they are my favorite land animal next we rode in a d-class vintage Mercedes throughout the sand dunes which was so much fun it was a total Vibe especially once the most beautiful sun began setting along the ride we spotted wild gazelles and even the incredible Arabian oryx the Arabian oryx were so cool I can't even describe private these are the official animal of the UAE and they're extremely long straight horns will truly blow you away when you're done adventuring you'll head back to camp for a delicious feast including all of the best Middle Eastern foods like hummus taboo Leaf fattoush lamb and finally you'll end the night with some traditional dancing and fire shows I absolutely love nights like these and I can't recommend doing a desert Safari tour enough and that is a wrap make sure to like and comment on this video so it gets pushed out to Travelers just like you we actually have two more videos you could watch on Dubai in this playlist right here right now we are in Bali for the next month and a half and we're gonna have tons of videos on that so make sure to subscribe so you always get notified foreign ;1915.9639999999997;1.8585944203544538;565;"['👇🏻  Best Dubai Tours

1VUB8Sm0kso;b'Your Travel Guide to Dubai in 2023 - THE BEST OF DUBAI';b'Adventure Singh';[Music] so you're planning a trip to the futuristic city of Dubai well Dubai is a vibrant and exciting City that offers something for everyone from towering skyscrapers to stunning beaches and world-class shopping being in the city feels like you're in a life-sized Disneyland and there's just so much to do with so little time that's why I've made this video to share with you some of the best things that I did while I was in Dubai and I'll be sharing a few hacks and tips so that you can save some money and make the best of your upcoming itinerary to Dubai itinerary it's a hard word to say [Music] so without further Ado let's get started with where you're going to be staying the two most popular places to stay at are downtown Dubai where most of the tourist attractions are and the Dubai Marina but given the fact that they're in the popular areas of Dubai you'll be paying higher prices so we stayed at the Radisson blue which cost around 170 dollars per night there's a third area that you can stay at which is slightly far off but it has a lot of budget options and that's an area called Dera where we stayed at a random hotel called Fortune hotel for just 80 a night because we were running out of money yep make sure you have your budget all planned out because if you don't you'll be like us and you'll start running out of money because you've spent a lot next up getting around Dubai which is extremely easy here dudes check it out I just got myself the latest and greatest fully specced out Aston Martin this right here is my new ride and here the metro and buses are well connected to all tourist attractions and it's very affordable a trip will cost you two to seven Dirhams but you can get a day pass card with unlimited trips for 20 Dirhams we made sure that the hotels we stayed at were a close walk to the Metro stations that way we could save on transport and spend more on other things if you don't want to use a Metro then taxis are a great way to get around they're slightly expensive however if you get an app called the Kareem app it's like the Dubai Uber prices are a lot cheaper on that app with that out of the way it's time to start exploring Dubai and for us on our first day we went straight to downtown to check out Dubai's number one highlights the Burj Khalifa and the Dubai Mall standing at a staggering 828 meters the Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world and offers breathtaking views of the city you can visit the observation deck on the 124th floor for about 40 bucks or you can go to the highest level which I think is the 140 something floor for a hundred and three bucks that's a steep difference but you're following the adventure sync Channel and I'm here to give you so much value I have another option which I'll share later on in the video so hold on to that money for now and let's go to the Dubai Mall it's right next to the Burj Khalifa and it's one of the largest shopping centers in the world with over 1500 stores in this mall you can literally shop until you drop however I found that prices at this mall are a little higher than other malls in Dubai mainly because it's a tourist attraction so if you want to do some serious shopping I recommend you save some bucks and shop at The Mall of the Emirates or the city center mall in Dera the Dubai Mall has tons of really cool and trendy looking restaurants and quite a number of interesting attractions like the aquarium which is home to over 140 species of marine life including sharks rays and colorful fish visiting the aquarium will cost up to 50 bucks depending on the season that you're going in but I highly highly recommend that you book skip the line tickets way in advance so that when you get to the mall you're not standing in long treacherously long lines we honestly didn't know about the massive lines and so we couldn't make it to the aquarium however we did see the aquarium from the outside and enjoyed it for free not as fun as the experience would have been if we did go inside but still very interesting to see an aquarium in a mall the mall also has tons of free attractions like the indoor waterfall and the dancing Fountain display that takes place every one hour in the evening oh my god wow the way they coordinate the music with the lights and the water that was amazing all right remember when I said that you should hold on to your money instead of going up to the top of the Burj Khalifa well welcome to the Dubai frame the Dubai frame is a relatively new addition to the city skyline we went here on our second day and it's a very interesting structure it's gold plated and the shape of a frame that stands at 150 meters tall and 93 meters wide and I personally think it offers better views than the Burj Khalifa on one side you can see the older parts of the city while on the other side you can see all the Modern Skyscrapers the futuristic city of Dubai it's such an interesting contrast and when you're at the top of the frame there's this glass feature that when you step on it kind of like turns from OPEC to transparent and you can see the bottom it's a very exhilarating and scary and fun at the same time so you should definitely check that out once you're on the other side of the frame you'll enter this sort of small Museum area where they showcased you what old Dubai looked like what their present is and what they want their future to be so in as well as getting to see awesome views from the top you also get a museum experience all that for just 14 and that's why you follow the adventures Inc Channel after visiting the frame we jumped onto the metro and hit up one of Dubai's latest attractions the Museum of the future you guys when I say this building is wow wow they nicknamed it the most beautiful building in the world unfortunately we didn't get a chance to enter and see but I've read that they have really futuristic exhibitions that would blow your mind please make sure to book in advance again at least two weeks in advance and I'll leave all the links below where you can make your bookings so that when you get to the destination you don't get disappointed because your dates are not available that's kind of what happened to us and it sucked so make sure you book everything in advance Dubai is a really popular place guys the next place we checked out that I really loved was the Dubai Marina so the Dubai Marina has a beautiful Waterfront Promenade now you can try to fit it in on your second day after the museum I'd highly recommend you get to the marina in the evening and stay there to watch it light up in the night it's such a Vibe when we got there we rented bicycles using the Kareem bike app and honestly it was such a fun way to experience the marina there's tons of activity happening along the beach for us we happen to stumble upon a free cooking and food testing event I was pleasantly surprised because I love free stuff especially if it's in Dubai there's loads of restaurants overlooking the marina and we ate at this Turkish restaurant it was quite pricey but I highly recommend it oh my gosh the food was so good and they're baklava oh my gosh I want to go back to Dubai Marina take a swim at the beach as you wait for the marina to light up and when it does you can take a ride on the largest ferris wheel in the world inspired by the London Eye again remember to book in advance on our third day we shopped in the morning and then headed to Old Town Dubai in the evening I'm actually really glad that we decided to go there in the evening because as we were exploring the traditional architecture and then making our way across the creek it was kind of like we landed in Aladdin while the sun was setting and everything just looked so beautiful it's kind of like I can show you the world Vibes oh so beautiful Old Town Dubai is the historic Heart of the City offering a glimpse into Dubai's past alright so I mentioned crossing the creek we did that on this traditional boat called an Abra and that's when we go to the souks and the markets where we explored and enjoyed all the beautiful spices that were out on display and there was this one shop that we went to in particular where the shop owner was so friendly he was showing us all the different spices he had making us smell the mental and he was just explaining what each spice does it was such a fun experience and he gave us some huge discounts so just check out this shop over here if you want to go to I highly recommend you go to that shop super friendly guy and also crazy thing he was giving us so many things for free on top of what we bought at the souks you'll also get to the gold souk where you can see some crazy record-breaking stuff like the largest ring in the world I think it's the largest necklace over here we also got snuck away into a shop where they made us try on traditional Arabic outfits which looks super cool I swear I could be a very good looking Arabic man there's lots of shopping that you can do at the soups and there's amazing street food that you can try here we ate loads of shawarmas had Masala tea it was such an amazing experience and I highly recommend on our final day we did a desert Safari tour it's basically a day trip where you go into the desert and you have a couple of different activities you can choose from so we did some Dune bashing where you get into a Land Cruiser it just drives so fast over the sand dunes you feel like you're going to die there's other activities like camel riding or getting into dune buggies and riding them yourself after that you get to enjoy a beautiful sunset before you go into this Arabic setup camp and you watch belly dances and fire shows as you're having dinner now for me unfortunately the tour company that we did this with I didn't enjoy the experience that much I felt like it was too sped up and it wasn't authentic but however after coming back from Dubai and watching other YouTube videos I've seen other tours where they give you a more exclusive experience it will be more authentic and you can do a lot more during your time in the desert so that's why I was still added this activity to the list of this video because I don't want you guys to go and book the wrong tour like we did so I'll leave a couple of links in the description box for you guys to check out you're welcome and there you have it the perfect Dubai itinerary that will allow you to experience the best of the city from its modern landmarks to the cultural heritage and I hope this video has helped you in your planning to Dubai let me know in the comments below where you're most excited about visiting and with that thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one peace ;1265.9290000000003;1.629633257473365;117;"['Ah, this makes me miss Dubai.

XzyFiah2GoE;b'Singapore Travel Guide: What I Wish I knew! (2023 Update)';b'The Nomadic Foodie';[Music] here are six things I wish I knew when visiting Singapore and the first one has to do with Singapore travel requirements so number one you really need to do the Singapore arrival card through the ICA app it's a free app by the Singapore government so this is immigration and checkpoints Authority and you really need to download the app and do it so one time when we were entering Singapore we didn't have it filled out on the app so I actually had to hurry up and fill it out on my phone um thankfully they do have Wi-Fi at the airport and even the causeway boots if you are driving from Malaysia to Singapore and actually this is another important thing if you're filling out the immigration arrival form on the app once you submit the form you can't edit the form at all not even by the officer at the booth ask me how I know another thing I wish I knew about Singapore is the jewel at the airport okay so it's open 24 hours that's what their website says but the actual waterfall it's not gonna run 24 hours because we got there like a little bit after 10 p.m it was not running and you know I expected things to be closed like restaurants and shops right since our website said that the jewel is open 24 hours we thought that men the fountain or the waterfall was gonna run 24 hours but that is not the case the building itself is open but you're just gonna see this gaping hole in the ceiling staring at you and is quite a sad thing so don't make this mistake like we did and make sure you check to see if the waterfall is gonna run before you plan out your trip there all right so this is another thing I wish I knew about Singapore so there's actually no need to exchange your American dollars or whatever currency into Singaporean dollars I went to all of the top sites without spending literally a single Singaporean coin everything was cashless so they do have money exchange places but you can save yourself some time and the hassle because you can just use your credit cards or debit cards if it has a Visa or MasterCard logo if you have American Express or discover you probably won't be able to use that but if you have like Visa or Mastercard you know the major credit cards you can totally use those so like from the food court and Marina Bay Sands to a really cute Cafe in Lane we were able to use our Apple wallet or Apple pay so everything was electronic and here's another one I wish I knew about Singapore so the MRT the first time you scan your Apple watch or some sort of payment method you're actually not paying for your ride the first time you scan it it's their system recognizing you as a passenger at a specific station and to exit the MRT station at your destination you're gonna have to scan your Apple watch or iPhone you know or somehow the payment and this is when you actually get charged and I wish I knew that because I was walking all over the place inside the MRT Station trying to find an exit without having to scan my phone because I was used to the Subways in New York where it charges you first before you you know go on the train so it charges you when you enter but not when you leave so it's actually opposite here in Singapore they actually don't charge you when you enter but they charge you if you want to leave so that's just a little tip so you're not walking around aimlessly to try to exit the MRT Station like I was and here's another tip so don't try to do too much walking outside between the hours of 11 A.M to 3 P.M you know we are used to a hot climate here in Florida so I thought we would be fine walking around in the afternoon sun because you know we're used to it and we had a lot of water you know I had my umbrella but it was a different kind of hot and sticky heat so I don't know if it's because there was more pavement and not as much like breeze you know and wind that day I don't know if it was because as maybe the AC levels weren't turned on as high as I was used to back home in Florida but just be really smart about planning around the heat so don't ruin your trip by you know getting sunburned or you know getting overheated here's one more thing so Gardens by the bay like I thought I could wander back and forth you know in the cloud forest but it's more of a guided pathway and it's a little tricky to backtrack so for the cloud forest get the shots you want before you move on even if it's you know crowded just kind of wait until you can take a picture because it's kind of tricky to backtrack so if you have more questions about Gardens by the bay please watch this video on my Singapore playlist and you can check out my Singapore playlist for more travel tips and where to eat in Singapore so I will see you in the next video foreign [Music] ;599.4910000000001;1.5496479513453911;135;"['UPDATE: All visitors must submit the SG Arrival Card to enter Singapore. I show how to do it in this video:<br><a href=""https://youtu.be/JXaByEAj0CA"">https://youtu.be/JXaByEAj0CA</a>', 'Jewel fountain does run 24 hours normally, but sometimes it closes for maintenance unexpectedly. It is cool to see it when it is not running too. It&#39;s the only time when there is no sound of rushing water.', 'The MRT charges you when you leave because that&#39;s the only way to automatically count and calculate it according to distance travelled. You log in where the journey starts, log out where it ends, and the system does the rest. It makes a lot of sense and is economically efficient.', 'This was SO helpful. I leave for Singapore in a week and I wondered if I could just use tap to pay everywhere because I really didn&#39;t want to have to exchange money like when I&#39;d visit Japan and end up withdrawing too much or too little. So knowing that I could use apple pay for nearly everything is SO helpful. Also, yeah I&#39;m afraid of the heat. I live in Hawaii and I am packing ONLY light airy clothes because I am expecting it to be brutally hot and muggy there. The info about the ICA Health declaration app is also so informative. I was wondering how I&#39;d need to submit it or what website to go to. Knowing there&#39;s an app makes it easier! Thanks for the vid! Love it!', 'Well, most food count at the shopping mall will accept payment by credit card or cash. But if you are going to those normal food count you still need cash. <br>American Express or diner club is still acceptable at some shops just that you need to ask. <br>MRT and all public transport are credit card “friendly” so just tap in and out! ☺️', 'Thank you so much for this because I have been planning my Singapore trip. I had no idea. These are very helpful. I hope this video gets more recognized by others who are planning to go to Singapore for the first time.', 'The jewel waterfall not running is the norm I think, at least for me, it was on everytime I go there, went there at 2pm in the afternoon recently, it was turned on, went there 8pm at night after a flight a month ago and it was turned on as well. Been there at least 5-6 times the past year and a half and it was always on, I think you were just unlucky and they were doing an impromptu maintenance.', 'Hello! I am traveling to Singapore in a few days, and just wanted to know about the MRT payment. Do we just need to use the wallet app to pay? Or is there a specific app we would need to download to pay? And is it more convenient than purchasing a ezlink/tourist pass? Thank you!!', 'This is so helpful since we will be going there in a few weeks as a family with three kids. I still wonder how I will get the kids through the MRT if we are going to using the same travel credit card/apple pay.', 'Good tips. Yes, the humidity here is crazy. So its super duper hot mid day. Together with the humidty, your body cant expell heat and it gets sticky and very uncomfortable.']";b'Travel & Events';226689;2017

97r67cnVpms;b'Amsterdam Travel Guide for 2024 | Places to visit in AMSTERDAM';b'Headout';"When it comes to a gorgeous, picturesque city
with fascinating history and culture, it is hard to beat Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
Amsterdam has it all - historical architecture, thrilling nightlife, and stunning natural
scenery. One of the most iconic aspects of Amsterdam is its canals, which wind their
way throughout the city, providing breathtaking views of its countless medieval and renaissance
buildings. No wonder it is called the Venice of the North! In this video, let us explore the best of
what Amsterdam has to offer! The best time to visit Amsterdam depends on
what you want to experience in the city. But be prepared, for the inclement weather, rain
and wind can come and go anytime! If you’re looking to see the iconic Dutch
bloom, visit during Spring, between March and May. If the quaint and quiet side of Amsterdam
is what you’re looking for, visit during Autumn when the leaves turn golden and vibrant. And visiting during the winter, one gets to
see the picturesque, snow-covered Amsterdam, with winter fairs and snow games happening
in the city. In addition to being one of the busiest airports
in the world, Schiphol Airport is a hub for many air travellers. Upon arriving at Schiphol,
go to the NS train station, directly beneath the plaza. The train will take you to Central
Station in Northern Amsterdam, from where you can easily explore the rest of the city.
With Amsterdam being one of the most visited and backpacked cities across Europe, there
are plenty of good neighbourhoods to stay in and explore. It's possible to find many
budget-friendly hostels as well as upscale and boutique hotels! For budget accommodation, the Old Centre is
the ideal neighbourhood to stay in. You’ll be a walk away from the main attractions,
principal shopping and nightlife areas too! If you want to stay with the locals, then
the Jordaan neighbourhood is your best bet. It is also the best place for longer stays
with the neighbourhood lined with quaint cafes and shops. And to thoroughly experience the nightlife
of Amsterdam, Leidseplein is the place to be. The area has the largest concentration
of theatres, music venues and nightclubs. The best way to see Amsterdam is by foot or
by bicycle! Also known as the bicycle city, there are designated bike lanes and traffic
lights! Also, there are plenty of places one can rent them. While you’re there if you’re looking to
have some fun with your friends or family, rent out a tandem bike and headout for your
Amsterdam expedition! You can also explore by boat, if bicycles
aren't your thing, thanks to its many canals that crisscross the city. What’s a trip
to Amsterdam without taking a cruise through the canals? The canal cruises usually take
one to two hours, giving you a unique perspective of the city, letting you admire its iconic
architecture and learn about its history. There are also trams and buses to explore
the various iconic landmark located around the city. The city’s public transportation
system is convenient, efficient and affordable. When in Amsterdam, there are a few must-see
classics that you absolutely cannot miss! Amsterdam's oldest church, the Oude Kerk (Old
Church), is just a short stroll from Central Station. The church no longer hosts services,
but is a hub for modern and historical art, with pieces made specifically for the space
by well-known artists. The Amsterdam town square, Dam Square, is
also a short stroll away. The square is constantly bustling with events like performance art,
locals getting together, and numerous tourist sites and attractions. At Dam Square, significant
historical occurrences like the liberation of Amsterdam from Nazi rule in 1945 took place.
And to commemorate the victims of World War Two, there is a national monument found at
the square! The De Nieuwe Kerk is a splendid neo-gothic
church constructed in the 15th century after the Oude Kerk grew too small to accommodate
Amsterdam's rising population. Although it now hosts art exhibitions, it once hosted
weddings and royal rituals. The Royal Palace of Amsterdam, which overlooks
Dam square, is a sight you shouldn't miss. The royal apartments decorated with priceless
art and antiques are open to visitors. The palace also boasts a fantastic museum
that chronicles the history of the Dutch Royal Family. On a side note, don’t forget to check out
the Big Wooden clog on Dam square. Originally, they were made to protect the feet of factory
workers. Today, it is a big part of the Netherlands’ history and culture. You can also buy a pair
from the many stores around the city! From here, travel to Amsterdam's most well-known
red-light district, De Wallen. There are numerous window-fronted shops rented out to sex workers
along its winding streets. De Wallen has a long history, and it was once home to many
brothels and other businesses associated with the sex trade. Nowadays, it is a tourist attraction,
with chic cafes and bars. Everyone should make the trip to the Old Heineken
Brewery to get an authentic taste of the Heineken Experience, unless, of course, you're underage.
The famous Heineken beer was created in this historic building and is now well-known all
over the world! You can experience the brewing process firsthand on these tours. Not far from here, is Vondelpark, a sprawling
park with attractions, including a playground, pond, and theatre. On hot summer days, the
park is filled with people sunbathing, playing games, and picnicking. In the autumn, the
leaves of the trees turn a beautiful golden colour, making it the perfect place to take
a stroll. With over 70+ museums, Amsterdam is home to
some of the most renowned museums. They also prove to be a great way to learn about the
city! Start your journey at Museumplein or the
Museum Quarter in the Oud-Zuid district of Amsterdam. Located here are three major museums
-  Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum and Stedelijk Museum. The National Museum of the Netherlands, Rijksmuseum,
is dedicated to dutch arts and history. Visitors can explore 800 years of historic Dutch art
spread across 8,000 pieces in 80 galleries. Some famous artists include Van Gogh, Vermeer
and Rembrandt. The Van Gogh Museum is the largest collection
of works by the legendary Dutch artist, including his famous paintings ""The Potato Eaters"" and
""The Starry Night."" But the museum is more than just a display of Van Gogh's work; it's
also a place to learn about his life and the times he lived in. One of the other museums in Museumplein that
offers a fascinating insight into Dutch art history is the Stedelijk Museum. It is home
to an impressive selection of modern and contemporary art, with works by Pablo Picasso and Henri
Matisse. But the building in itself is a work of art, with its iconic curved facade and
stunning glass atrium. Something is humbling about visiting the Anne
Frank House. It shows how one person – Anne Frank – can make a difference even in the
darkest of circumstances. The museum is in the same building where Anne Frank and her
family hid from the Nazis for over two years. It's small but packed with information about
Anne and her life in hiding during the Holocaust. Another fascinating museum that is sure to
blow your mind away is Body Worlds. Through the process of plastination, human bodies
are preserved, allowing people to see the vulnerability and complexity of the human
body. Several exhibits feature interactive features and display the bodies in various
positions. If you're looking for a real taste of Amsterdam,
then you'll want to head to the Nieuwmarkt. This historic square is home to a daily market
where you can find fresh produce, flowers, and delicious Dutch foods, especially Dutch
gouda! Be sure to try the traditional herring or the Dutch pancake. Alternatively, head to the Albert Cuyp Market.
This open-air market is packed with stalls selling everything from fresh seafood to Dutch
cheeses. You can also find Thai food, Indian food, and much more. Be sure to try the stroopwafels,
which are wafers filled with caramel syrup. If you're looking for a change of scenery
from Amsterdam, there are plenty of great day trips from the city. You can explore charming
villages, or visit some of Holland's famous tulip blooms.
During spring, make sure to visit Bollenstreek. This is where rows of tulips of varied colours
bloom! Every year, more than 7 million flowers bloom at the Keukenhof gardens, whose scent
is unforgettable. The charming town of Zaanse Schans is known
for its windmills, and it's a great place to get a sense of Dutch history and culture.
Originally, these windmills were used to grind grain and pump water, but today they are mostly
tourist attractions. Or visit the prettiest village in the Netherlands,
Giethoorn. It's easy to see why this Dutch village is called the ""Venice of the North.""
Quaint canals wind their way through the town, and charming bridges span them at every turn.
And the best way to explore the village is by renting a boat!
Volendam is a small town located to the North of Amsterdam, about 25 minutes from the city.
It is best known for its traditional Dutch culture and picturesque setting. Here, explore
the town's cobbled streets, visit old windmills, and sample local dutch cheese! That concludes the end of our extensive guide
to Amsterdam! This eclectic city is home to beautiful architecture, interesting museums
and lively nightlife. If you’re planning to head there soon, make sure to visit headout.com

our ultimate 10 day Peru itinerary we flew from DFW to Miami Miami to Lima and Lima to Cusco our travels to Cusco were anything but smooth but we are hopefully going to Peru maybe stick until the end of this video and we'll tell you that side of the story we chose to stay at the Palacio del Inca a historic Mansion built on ink and temple ruins and now it's a hotel conveniently located near cusco's Main Attraction since Cusco is over 11 000 feet above sea level we took it easy on Arrival Day to acclimate and avoid altitude sickness our first day in Cusco was a blast after starting the morning with cocoa tea and breakfast we headed out to explore the city we visited Saxe woman a stunning Inca ruined site all right we're headed up to Sac State woman and I would be lying if I said that we weren't feeling that altitude Ian explored Plaza de armas the Central Square which is surrounded by historic buildings shops and restaurants in between the exploring we had some chance to eat some delicious food let me tell you Cusco has some of the coolest restaurants in the world here are a few that we recommend day two in Cusco is all about that food we ease into the day with a lazy morning before heading to the San Pedro Market to explore and Sample The Local Foods we're at the San Pedro Market it's this massive shopping area with everything from fruits to breads the meats anything you can imagine and it's pretty busy so we're buying a bunch of stuff for our cooking class with our guide and then we're gonna go back to the studio and cook it so it should be fun that evening we participated in a cooking class where we learned how to make traditional Peruvian dishes Goose looks better this one this one day three was an adventure we hopped in a van from our hotel in Cusco and headed to the star Lodge in the sacred Valley picture this you're sleeping in a pod hanging off the side of a cliff we've got a full video about the star Lodge so if you're curious check out this link and join us for an unforgettable experience hello this is Lauren and Garrett and pod six we're coming down copy see you soon hey let's go it's really scary uh I'm really scared of heights it was fun like I had a great time but going up in the dark for the third time was a pretty tough so I'm glad to get in here I'm not going to leave until tomorrow and then I'm gonna get down as fast as possible so yeah on day four we were set to visit ancient ruins and the Salt Flats but fate had other plans we ended up walking for about three hours from our Cliffside star Lodge to our hotel in eurobomba and boy was it an adventure but that's not even the half of it you have to watch the full video to hear the whole back story despite the unexpected turn of events we still had an amazing day exploring the tombow Del Inca sipping coffee at local shops and savoring a delicious dinner the hotel was gorgeous but we'd recommend staying in oyante tombow instead because there's more things to do and just when we thought that they couldn't get any Wilder we were picked up and literally smuggled to our campsite to start our hike on the Inca Trail Days five through eight were spent hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu the stunning beauty of the Andes Mountains the ancient ruins and breathtaking scenery made every step worth it the Inca it was challenging with its ups and its downs but the reward of reaching the iconic Machu Picchu was priceless I'm so happy we highly recommend hiking the Inca Trail and we've got a full review video and packing guides to help you plan your own adventure don't miss out on this Unforgettable experience on day nine we were exhausted from all the hiking we rode the Vista dome train back to oyete tombow and from there we took a bus back to Cusco we decided to hit up the spa after the hike to adequately recover and shop for souvenirs for our friends and our family day 10 was our travel day which we were flying back home to the United States with memories of a lifetime okay so time to be a hundred percent honest about the experience our Peru trip was insane we had it all planned out perfectly but then the unexpected happened we are hopefully going to Peru maybe the Latin plane wreck in Lima airport shut down not to mention some of the largest protests in Peru's history through a wrench into our plans farmers are striking in eurobumba so we are walking from the Star Lodge back to our urobama hotel it's like a three-hour hike just walking on the main road yeah we're just walking on the main road trying to be respectful but did we let that stop us no way we work with some amazing vendors to make quick modifications and still enjoyed the things we were most excited about we got picked up from our hotel at 10 30. or No 9 30 p.m it is now 11 30 and all the roads are blocked all the protesters are having a fiesta I'm not feeling too confident that we're gonna get past any roadblock but sure we missed out on some awesome spots like the oyetan tombow ruins and some incredible restaurants in Cusco but setbacks aside we had an incredible adventure with their family and we are already planning our next trip to Asia where we'll explore Taiwan

Mro_jiLg5Uk;b'Tokyo Five-Day Itinerary | Your Perfect Travel Guide For a 5 Day Trip';b'Highkey Trips';[Music] so you finally decided to book your trip to Japan and are now trying to plan out your itinerary today we've got an ideal five-day plan for the city that should be the first stop on your trip Tokyo so let's begin Welcome to our Channel where we share with you all of the amazing places on this planet to put on your bucket list if you are new here we know you're going to like it here and if you're a subscriber thank you for coming back without further Ado here we go Tokyo is a Neon Jungle of colorful lights and unique experiences it brings together the Asian traditions and modern energy that radiates through every nook and cranny attracting thousands of tourists annually in today's video we'll review the ideal five-day itinerary for your next trip to Tokyo be sure to stay till the very end of the video where we'll share some fun Insider Japanese facts day one visit teamlab planets Shinjuku omoide yokocho and Shibuya we believe that your first day in a country should be all about experiences encapsulating the country's spirit and aesthetic this is why our first day plans in Tokyo are all about spots and activities that'll make you feel like a local the first agenda item on our five-day Tokyo itinerary is a magical visit to team lab planets this body immersive Museum offers visitors a once in a lifetime experience by touching and heightening every one of their five senses while the scale of this Museum rests on the smaller side with a total of seven artworks to show it's more about how these pieces come together to create a vibrant and gorgeous display of colors and emotion the museum is a Barefoot experience because some rooms require you to be knee-deep in water so you might want to wear something comfortable or at least bring a change of clothes and shoes if you get hungry after the display you can have a carefully planned and delectable meal at the Museum's restaurant which is equally beautiful our second stop for the day will be at Shinjuku after an immersive experience at Team lab planets this perfectly technological part of town looks like it came straight out of a comic strip so whatever expectations you have of Tokyo in your mind Shinjuku will probably Supply each and every one of them Shinjuku is home to numerous malls and taller than you can imagine skyscrapers not to mention the bars and clubs that shine through the night so if you want to shop till you drop this little Japanese Nook can feel like a slice of paradise to you but suppose the fast-paced hustle and bustle of City Life aren't ideal for your dream vacation in that case you can go to the national park for a relatively calm experience amongst trees and flowers Shinjuku is also an ideal area to grab a bite in quite little cafes mostly known to locals as such it offers an authentic experience of what it's like to be in Tokyo also known as Memory Lane amoide yokicho is another place for locals to go and get food and drinks while Memory Lane doesn't sound like a place where people would go to eat this is actually one of the most popular spots to wine and dine in the city this is the place for traditional Japanese Cuisine and small traditional pubs known as izakayas there are 60 izakayas in amoide yokicho making it the top place for drinks in the city when you're at an Izakaya you don't have to worry about getting food from somewhere else because the upside of These Bars is that they offer food along with your drinks the downside however is that these pubs are tiny with few seats in the whole place but if you're looking to get up close and personal with bar owners this is the perfect opportunity the final stop of our first day's route is at Shibuya because this part of Tokyo is where all the locals go for a night out think of Shibuya as the Times Square of Tokyo you'll find all the same vibes from the sparkling lights Billboards and tall buildings once you're in the area this neighborhood is especially preferred by people involved in artistic practices because it's excellent for people watching but most people go to Shibuya for a different reason the district is also home to the busiest intersection in the city also known as scramble Crossing this spot is famous for its photography opportunities so the perfect plan for a night in Shibuya would be to wander around after having dinner at amoide yokucho and grab dessert in one of the many cafes in the area before going for that photo opportunity day two see the Meiji Shrine Harajuku Tokyo Tower and happy Pancake Day two is mainly about seeing important landmarks and exposing yourself to new tastes and stories so we've compiled some must-see places to surround you with beautiful sights trendy stores and good food the Meiji Shrine and yoyogi park are synonymous in Tokyo and it's a great location to immerse yourself in the traditions of Japan this is why we're starting the second day with a trip to Meiji Shrine the shrine sits quietly in the middle of a 170 acre Park full of Evergreen and cherry blossom trees providing a tranquil spot for people who want to snatch a moment of peace and quiet you can watch people as they leave offerings at The Shrine take strolls through the park or even witness a traditional wedding if you're in luck our next stop after the Meiji Shrine is the most famous tower in all of Tokyo the Tokyo Tower is a symbol of rebirth the monument was built in 1958 soon after the second world war ended paying homage to the country's efforts in defending their land The Architects were inspired by the Eiffel Tower and making this Landmark at the time of its completion the building had surpassed Eiffel and height standing at 333 meters Tokyo Tower attracts several tourists daily thanks to its observation decks and photo-worthy sites as a beautiful sightseeing spot but that's not all the Tokyo Tower is also strategically placed and surrounded by many attractions visitors can enjoy these attractions before and after their tour of the building some of the most popular spots in the surrounding area include suzoji Temple and sheba Park the third stop for day two's itinerary is excellent for young visitors Harajuku is a Social Hub of any young individual in Tokyo therefore it's full of trendy spots and instagramable setups the teenage culture is the driving factor in Harajuku so many shops are focused on selling items that are popular with the teen crowd but this doesn't mean adults will not have a good time in the area there are several boutiques and shopping options alongside cafes and restaurants where people far beyond their teenage years they can all also visit the Meiji jingu Temple to squeeze in a cultural activity while they're in the vicinity you'll love this next stop if you're not serious about your pancakes to top off our second day in Tokyo we recommend that you go to a happy pancake for dessert after having your meal at Harajuku while this pancake Eatery has several locations throughout Tokyo it's best known for the one in Harajuku a happy pancake has the fluffiest and most affordable desserts in the area it's also one of their more spacious locations giving you extra room to hang out and enjoy your pancakes this wraps up our second day in Tokyo with a sweet spot if you are enjoying this video so far please hit that subscribe button for more content like this it really helps out our small Channel and we appreciate it from the bottom of our hearts day three hang out at the Tokyo Art Aquarium a ninja restaurant and Electric City being in Tokyo starts to feel all the more accurate when you hang out in Tech hubs or spend time in spaces that Japan is best known for our third day itinerary aims to do just that by taking you to Neon Museum's fabulous restaurants and some of Tokyo's most popular entertainment areas starting in Ginza our third day plans include visiting the Tokyo Art Aquarium this unique art museum is a display of color and lights everywhere hundreds of thousands of Goldfish swim in differently shaped glass tanks throughout the aquarium the placement of it all creates a unique and compelling experience especially for first-timers our next stop ninja restaurant is an eating experience that's authentically found in Japan since ninjas are such a prominent part of Japanese culture it's impossible to wander through the streets of Tokyo without paying homage to the ancient warriors that once guarded the country and the ninja restaurant at akasaka does precisely that agasaka is a longwanding ninja Village that's now a popular tourist Hub of Japanese warrior culture the ninja Village remains perfectly intact and the restaurants in the area are all operated by ninjas some even offer unique displays and let you meet with Ninja Masters in short this Village is a perfect lunch option before you continue to explore the streets of Tokyo and it's an absolute must since you can only experience this in Tokyo after the akasaka ninja restaurant our trip continues on to the electric city of Tokyo this part of town is best known for the different and affordable kinds of electronics that it offers so if you are Tech Enthusiast then electric city will feel like home to you akiyabara is home to All Things tech savvy it's also where most locals get their electronic needs there are two reasons for that one because the area is so affordable and two because a kiabatta encapsulates the authentic Japanese Spirit you see on TV shows and movies anime themed manga and video shops line up the streets alongside the gadget stores making this the perfect placed a window shop or bring something home as memorabilia day 4 visit the sensaji temple and Ito taito Craft Center the itinerary focuses on Art so today we'll take you to a temple best known for its dancing activities followed by a unique arts and craft Center that doubles as a museum senzoji Temple is not your ordinary Temple because while people go here to worship their gods they also go here to dance while these dances are nothing like going to a club they are close to the Japanese Buddhist Traditions you can learn a few traditional dances or even partake in a fun Bean throwing session during your time here while in the area stop by the Edo taito crafts center and learn more about the handcrafted items the Japanese take pride in you can even watch as Craft Masters carve these objects out of wood blocks since the crafts center doubles as a museum these objects will be available as souvenirs remember to look at the diagrams that show all the skills passed down for generations of Japanese Artisans pictures are allowed in the museum but using flash isn't recommended ticket prices vary by age and season day five spend some time at the Cherry Blossom Gardens before wrapping up we have something a little more relaxing for your last day in Tokyo since most last days are heavy on packing it's often a good idea to keep your visits short and enjoyable this is why we recommend you spend your last day in Tokyo in a cherry blossom Garden possibly having a picnic with an excellent book or Manga rakujin Gardens in Tokyo is one of the best places to have a moment alone pack a bag grab a book and enjoy being surrounded by these fantastic sakura trees now let's look at some interesting Japanese facts before we wrap up number one over half of the country is covered in trees most of which are evergreens are cherry blossoms number two Tokyo is the most crowded city in the world number three only 1.5 percent of the people in Japan are immigrants number four Japan experiences more than 1500 earthquakes every year Tokyo is perfect for

Yes, the trees are always there, but they only bloom during a few weeks in the Spring.', 'Thank you so much! I’m going in March just to see the cherry blossom 🌸 this itinerary was much needed since I feel overwhelmed already', 'Great info. However, the music was too loud and became annoying after 5 minutes.

Any weather tips you may share are more than welcome', 'Location recommendations are good but logistics made no sense. Tourists are likely to take the metro to get place to place,  day 1 sends the folks all the way to the south then goes to the central west east. Day 2 tells them to go to the west then east. Another day then tells them to the Center, south and then North, etc. It would have made more sense to group the days by area. So anyone on the west side visits Shibuya, Harajuku and shinjuku.', 'thank you for the info about team lab!

5XzoeHVwu4Q;b'23 INSANELY CHEAP Destinations for Budget Travel in 2023';b'Lexie Limitless';it's a new year and you know what that means it's time to plan our new travel destinations without breaking the bank I've compiled what I consider to be some of the absolute best travel destinations to visit on a budget in 2023 and by budget I mean anywhere between 20 and 50 US dollars per day just remember every destination can be budget friendly if you're committed to getting creative with your travels and with that here's my list of the best budget travel destinations to check off your bucket list this year depending on what areas of the country you want to explore turkey is a great choice for Budget Travel certain experiences here can be really pricey but if you're committed to planning turkey can be done relatively cheaply if City life is more your speed you can't miss the capital Istanbul I have fond memories of visiting the city when I traveled alone and on a budget to save money and have a great experience you can visit the open air museums visit Galata Tower and have a picnic in front of the mosque overlooking the city skyline filled with so much Rich history and natural phenomenons one place you have to check out is Cappadocia located in the south central region of the country Cappadocia is home to some of Nature's most unique architecture you might be tempted to jump on one of the many hot air balloon rides that are popular around Cappadocia but for about a hundred and fifty dollars there are better ways to see the views on a budget for example you can get up close to the land during a one hour horseback riding tour for about 30 dollars you won't have to worry about finding inexpensive Foods as turkey is home to what I consider some of the best and cheapest Foods in the world if I could go back there right now I would definitely be filling up with Turkish Delights and donor kebabs which you can't skip if you're going to be visiting the country when you're ready to travel to Europe this year Slovenia is a great budget destination option besides having walkable cities there are plenty of places to explore for free while hiking in the northwest corner of the country head to Lake bled nestled among some of the most stunning mountain ranges in Slovenia here you can hike relax and take in views that feel magical one of slovenia's gems has to be the Socha Valley this area draws in so many hikers because of the clear blue rivers and Rocky Mountain terrain I'd say don't underestimate this country if you're looking for an outdoor Escape if you're visiting lubiana make sure to pick up a lubiana card this card is your ticket to maxing out the city on a budget it offers free tours Transportation bike rentals and a trip on a funicular it costs under forty dollars with 36 and 74 hour card options let's just say you won't go hungry on a budget here meals vary between eight and twenty dollars and if you stop at a grocery store you can expect to pay around forty dollars for the week accommodation is also very cheap in Slovenia a hostel can cost about 16 a night while the standard for a hotel is more around the Forty dollar a night range Vietnam comes in as one of the cheapest countries to visit in Asia and it's also one of my favorites because of how unbelievably beautiful the Landscapes are there's the Limestone islands of hey Long Bay exploring Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi among the other beautiful places to see along the coast one of the reasons it's such a great country to travel on a budget is because of its Transportation the variety of Transportation options from sleeper buses to trains is a great place for Backpackers looking to explore for Less although it can get pricey to get to Vietnam from the US once you're there you can expect to pay an average of five to ten dollars a night on accommodation ten dollars a day on food and five dollars on Transportation by the way if you're looking for unique ways to finance your travels then listen up many Travelers myself included know that the key is having your money working for you even while you're jetting around the world but this year most investment strategies have struggled to provide the results we're used to and that's why I was amazed to learn about something that's hitting record highs and best of all I learned how you can possibly use it to your benefit well what is it investing in fine art with Masterworks it's surprising to hear I know but huge Banks like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have art investing services and for the last three years Masterworks has been featured in Publications like Forbes for handing back Real Results to their users using Fine Art they file paintings like picassos with SEC splitting them into shares Masterworks doesn't do crypto or nfts these are the real things worth millions and and all of Masterworks filings are linked in the description at sec.gov Masterworks just had another sale at the end of last month handing back a 13.9 net return to their users that brings them to nine X's four of them just since September those four sales returned 13 17 21 and 33 net so it's no wonder that Masterworks paintings have sold out in minutes but you can get Priority Access right away by clicking the link in the description now let's jump back into the next destination on our list Columbia if you're ready to explore in nature consider adding Columbia to your budget bucket list did you know that it's home to 10 of the world's biodiversity especially if you love coffee you can take a tour of the country's Coffee Bean region while taking in views of rolling mountains and farmland one city you absolutely have to see is the entire city is considered a world heritage site and it's full of historic architecture it's also one of the most visited cities in Colombia making it a great place for Backpackers to make some friends and find some cheap eats for those of you who want to work remote Medellin has become a hot spot for digital Nomads and of course you can't go wrong with a visit to the country's capital Bogota there you will also fall in love with the city's architecture and charm if you've got some extra cash on hand and really want to take in what the country has to offer then I recommend renting a motorcycle during my last trip to Colombia I did this and it was an unforgettable experience I rode all the way up to guadape and it was beautiful Colombia is also fit for just about any budget for accommodation you can expect to spend anywhere between seven and twelve dollars a night while on food I budget around eight dollars and transportation roughly four dollars if you haven't already third Montenegro is becoming more and more popular from its Charming Couture old town on the coast to the caves in the mountains it's easy to understand why it's becoming such a must visit for so many tourists in Montenegro you can soak up the coastal life and quaint little cities like budva or enjoy the historical towns scattered throughout the country the best part is that you can experience this slice of Europe on a backpacker's budget you should expect to spend about forty dollars a day on accommodation seven dollars on food and about five dollars on Transportation sorry when you think of Peru you probably think of Machu Picchu this wonder of the world can be done on a budget but so can the rest of the country there's so much more to see in Peru and you could easily spend a month or more deeply exploring what most Travelers skip Peru is full of History there's archaeological sites like the rediscovered City chan chan destinations built in the middle of the sand mountains of hawakashina and the Nazca Lines etched into the desert there's a lot to see in Peru but it can be done for cheap if you want to keep the cost of travel down while traveling in Peru make sure to eat locally Peru is full of street food that's inexpensive and delicious Mexico is a classic destination if you're interested in getting away on a budget it's such a vast country with Rich culture and some of the world's best food there are beaches with Deep Blue Water beautiful rolling mountains and even Mayan ruins Mexico is such a large country that you'll never run out of places to explore from cities to Outdoor Adventures any budget traveler is bound to have a great experience while traveling here as for safety there are plenty of places in Mexico that are very safe to visit but before you go make sure you do your own research and check local guidance on the current safety situations in any areas that you may want to explore as always one of my biggest pieces of advice for keeping your costs down is to live like locals that may mean eating way too many street tacos and finding hole in the wall places to use as a way of exploring Mexican culture traveling between big cities in Mexico is where things start start to become pretty pricey so I recommend spending as much time in one place as you can to cut down on those kind of costs and also I highly recommend avoiding the really touristy areas like Tulum for the best budget prices the Philippines is made up of over 7 000 Islands which makes it a destination you'll want to visit again and again to truly soak in the Philippines I recommend leaving the city behind and exploring the many hidden gems throughout the country if you're planning on visiting the Philippines on a budget then make sure to add in some time to relax I recommend visiting the islands of Palawan or Cebu for a few days to unwind with Incredible views for around 25 you can even book a boat experience to snorkel with whale sharks as for accommodation hostels are definitely the cheapest at around seven dollars a night food and transportation are also very budget friendly for meals depending on where you go you can expect to spend about four dollars and transportation up to ten dollars a day one of the things that makes Laos so unique is that it isn't overrun with tourists what last lacks in tourism it makes up for in about 70 Forest coverage so if you're looking for another amazing place to explore in nature a trip to Laos is definitely for you when you go don't miss the quangsi waterfall in the Wang prabang kayaking on the Mekong River or exploring the capital city vietvang definitely not pronouncing that one right when you're ready to return to City Life the best part is that you're not gonna have to break the bank to make this trip happen you can expect to spend around thirty dollars in total for accommodation food and transportation per day so if you've already traveled to Thailand and you're looking for a new adventure then nearby Laos is a great place to go and speaking of Thailand Thailand is on just about the top of everyone's bucket list because of its affordability culture food and Beauty it's easy easy to see why Chiang Mai and Bangkok have quickly become some of the biggest destinations for digital Nomads it's here that your money will stretch far enough for luxury to become affordable my biggest recommendations are going island hopping in Phuket dive into all of the street food and visit unique markets and explore the ancient temples as for the daily price you may have noticed in my last video traveling across Thailand you can easily keep your daily costs between 20 and 30 dollars a day or less you may have heard about it but the rumors are true Cambodia has it all and on a budget you can explore its regions for months it's totally possible to Trek through Cambodia on a total daily budget of 25 Cambodia is home to islands that are beautiful not highly visited and cheap if you're looking for a trip that isn't completely on the beach side check out the amazing temples in Sim reap you can explore these ancient places for about forty dollars a day but if you plan on being in that area for a bit then I recommend getting a three to seven day pass because trust me you'll want to go back and of course you can't miss the world's largest religious complex angle or what this stunning Temple will leave you wanting to uncover more of this country's mysterious hidden history I know most people don't associate Greece with budget travel but I'm here to show you just how possible it can be keep in mind that the time of year you plan on traveling to Greece makes a big difference when it comes to price the summer months are always the most expensive so stay away from July and August which also happen to be the hottest I recommend planning your trip for the spring that way you can soak up as much of what makes grease so special without breaking the bank for a secret grease money saving tip buy your produce from markets and do some of your own cooking Greek restaurants can be pricey so cutting down on small costs like this can help you stick to a budget if you're traveling to Greece then don't miss out on the ancient ruins of Athens and avoid the overpriced and overcrowded islands like Santorini and Mykonos instead opt for some of the lesser-known islands like kefalonia and paros one of the many reasons Sri Lanka is so easy to visit is because it's a really small country this makes it a great place to kick off your adventures if you're new to backpacking stay away from the south coast of the country which is the most touristy and head to Candy to take the train to Ella it's one of Sri Lanka's most beautiful train routes over the course of the six hour ride you'll get sweeping views of the Lush Countryside tea plantations and waterfalls you can discover what makes Sri Lanka so special yourself for about forty dollars a day most people visit Guatemala for its Lush eco-tourism and Wildlife to get really close to Nature you can hike one of the country's 37 volcanoes or visit at titlan National Reserve if you want to dive head first into Guatemalan food culture then don't miss out on any of the Fresh Markets there are plenty of cooking classes where you can learn how to prepare traditional meals with the guidance of a local there really are endless things to discover in this pocket of Central America and for about thirty dollars a day you can weave your way through Guatemala's unbeatable Landscapes El Salvador is one country that's always overlooked when it comes to Central American adventures and it's also another destination that's jam-packed for outdoor lovers so by visiting national parks hiking volcanoes and surfing on the beautiful beaches it's a great place to soak up the tropics on a budget since this place is still a Hidden Gem you can get by on about 35 a day which includes accommodation food and transportation it's also incredibly inexpensive to travel between cities the average price of an inner city bus ticket is two dollars there also aren't big price differences between the high and low Seasons which makes El Salvador a great place to visit just about any time of year I hate to break it to you but you won't find any vampires in Romania but you will find amazing European Budget Travel if you do want to get close to the dark history of Romania you can visit Bran Castle of Transylvania known as Dracula's castle for only 17 in comparison to other European destinations Romania is just waiting to be discovered by the budget conscious traveler I'd recommend taking advantage of free walking tours in the main cities or just creating your own there is so much stunning architecture to be discovered throughout the country that you could spend weeks just roaming the streets and for just about thirty dollars a day you can explore one of Europe's Best Kept Secrets if you love exploring the Underwater World then it's time to move Belize to the top of your bucket list one thing that no one can miss is the Great Blue Hole it's a giant sinkhole where you can snorkel swim and dive and even if you're new to snorkeling and Diving there are plenty of beaches where you can also relax belize's affordability is hard to turn down for about thirty dollars a day you can have some Unforgettable experiences and with this money I recommend touring the ancient ruins seeing iguanas and sea turtles in their natural habitat and visiting one of the many vibrant markets the most inexpensive time to soak in this Central American destination is from May to November backpacking through Morocco is the cheapest way to experience this slice of Africa and one of the best places to visit is Marrakesh but there are so many activities that you can experience here there's hiking exploring sand dunes surfing and so much architecture to admire there are so many other amazing cities like Fez and Chef shaolan the blue City but for me it was hard not to visit Morocco and become completely captivated by the Sahara this is actually one of my earliest travel backpacking Memories Back In 2016. I took a camel ride out into the middle of the desert and was able to Camp with the Bedouins overnight under an amazing night sky filled with stars and it's something I will truly never forget and lucky for you you can explore this small Slice of Heaven for about 35 a day I've said it before and I'll say it again Poland has everything you'll find in Western Europe but for half the price so if you've spent any time exploring in Europe adding Poland to your bucket list is a must it's so easy to have an authentic local experience in Poland because there are way fewer tourists than most other countries in Europe to truly get a feel for the country I recommend taking in the mountainous Countryside soaking in the colorful architecture in Warsaw and spending time at any and all of the free museums you can for about forty dollars a day Poland is a top destination for experiencing Europe without breaking the bank whether you're looking for an adventurous vacation or simply a break on the Beach Costa Rica is the place to be for both Costa Rica has some of the best national parks and wildlife in the world it's also an incredible place to experience how coffee is made to chase waterfalls hang out in one of the many surf towns and catch a break from fast-paced life if you've saved up the cash to splurge every once in a while on your budget trip using that money to go ziplining through the canopy of the cloud forest will be money well spent for as little as 45 a day you can experience what Pura Vida truly means Malaysia is often used as a stopover point for travelers on their way to other areas of Asia but I'm here to prove that it's not only another destination that has it all but it can be done on a budget from the urban life of Kuala Lumpur to the island life to the many tea plantations scattered throughout the country there are endless ways to stretch your money in this Asian country to save as much money as possible dive into the world of street food you'll likely be able to enjoy Cuisine from Malaysia's surrounding countries which weave their way into the food here you can expect to spend between one to three dollars on street food that you can eat during your entire visit for around thirty dollars a day you can fall in love with this underrated piece of Asia that you'll likely want to return to again and again okay I know we've talked a lot about underrated countries today but I have another one for you Uzbekistan surprisingly one of the highlights of my trip to Tashkent was riding in the Metro you've probably become used to thinking of modes of transportation as nothing special but not in Central Asia's largest city each Metro is decked out in different types of architecture and art for locals it's almost like commuting in a modern art museum if you're on the hunt for more jaw-dropping architecture then don't miss out on one of the oldest cities in Central Asia that's still inhabited Samarkand for history Buffs experiencing this piece of the Silk Road in person is way better than any textbook because of unique experiences like this the sand colored region of Uzbekistan should Edge just a little bit higher on your must-see list for an average price of 40 a day you can uncover everything this country has in store speaking of ancient places Jordan has to be one of the coolest places to visit if you're interested in exploring ancient ruins and diving into hidden history with places like Petra's Treasury and the Wadi Rum desert its destinations like Jordan that continue to surprise me not only with their amazing Heritage sites but also with their prices for up to sixty dollars a day you can explore all the hidden features of a country that's coded in history for cheap and there you have it my top recommendations for places to see in this world on a backpacker's budget let me know in the comments if any of these destinations will make it onto your 2023 bucket list and don't forget to subscribe and like this video so we can share these top travel destinations with even more people but until then let's push our limits ;2679.3589999999976;1.410785191532752;476;"['Skip the waitlist and invest in blue-chip art for the very first time by signing up for Masterworks: <a href=""https://masterworks.art/lexielimitless"">https://masterworks.art/lexielimitless</a><br>Purchase shares in great masterpieces from artists like Pablo Picasso, Banksy, Andy Warhol, and more. 🎨 <br><br>See important Masterworks disclosures: <a href=""http://masterworks.io/cd"">http://masterworks.io/cd</a>', 'Exploring new countries is such a rewarding experience!

iOB6gXgtdwo;b'6 Key Tips for Travel to Japan!';b'Nom Life';if you're heading to Japan here's our six most useful travel tip while you're out make sure to always have cash on you cash is King and it's always easy to find an ATM at convenience stores to make reservations for restaurants you can ask your hotel reception to help book if they're not available to book online we found this incredibly helpful you'll also want to write down some basic Japanese phrases to get around Google translate and Google Lens will be your best friends to easily share addresses with cabs or read menus and signs pointing at things also does the trick another tip you'll want to wear easily removable shoes some restaurants will have tatami mats or areas without shoes required and being able to slip your shoes on and off will make this a lot easier you'll also definitely want to lower your volume of talking and on your phone especially indoors to be respectful of others and how loud your conversations are and final tip load up your Metro card you can load your plasma card and easily tap in and out of Subway rides and you can use it to pay at some stores and vending machines it is super convenient safe travels ;113.618;1.848298685067507;245;"['Another good tip is to bring an empty plastic bag.  There are absolutely no public trash cans.  Your garbage is your own so keep a bag handy so you don&#39;t have to make your pockets or bag dirty.', '1) don&#39;t walk while eating/drinking, it&#39;s bad manners (edit: apparently this one is debatable, I saw a bunch of signs in markets saying not to eat/drink while walking, but locals are saying that&#39;s not a thing, so do what you want I guess)<br>2) if there&#39;s a restroom or garbage can, use it. You don&#39;t know when you&#39;ll see another one<br>3) you will need an IC card for every individual person if you&#39;re going to use it on trains/subways. I only got one and ended up having to manually buy tickets for my fiancé <br>4) waitstaff will not generally check in on you periodically like they do in America, you&#39;ll have to flag them down. Master the &quot;sumimasen&quot; and especially &quot;okaike onegaishimasu,&quot; as otherwise you won&#39;t be leaving the restaurant in any timely manner until they notice you looking uncomfortable lol<br>5) double check the direction of travel of the train you&#39;re about to board. This may be obvious if you&#39;re used to public transportation, but I drive everywhere where I live and have basically never been on a train before going to Japan, so early in my trip I neglected to check the direction of travel and ended up going one stop in the wrong direction. No biggie, I just went back, but that leads me to the next tip:<br>6) if you ride the wrong direction, get off the train at the next stop but then get back on the platform heading the right direction rather than exiting the gates and getting a new ticket to come back in, if possible. I paid for a ticket unnecessarily because I didn&#39;t realize I could&#39;ve just found my way to the other side of the tracks without exiting the gates and ridden back the direction I was heading on the ticket I already had. It only cost me like $2 extra, but it was annoying. <br><br>I can probably come up with more if folks find these helpful, these were a lot of the ones I wish I could&#39;ve known before I went', 'Personalize your passmo/metro card and keep it as a souvenir. You&#39;ll have the option to put your name on it, consider doing [your name] [year].', 'The hotels will help with reservations and holding stuff for you. <br>I’d add that if you’re traveling to different areas, like from Tokyo to Kyoto, send your luggage first. The hotel will have an area for this and some hotels will take them to your room so they’re already up in your room when you arrive. It costs a little per bag, but it’s so convenient to travel without a bunch of luggage.', 'When I went to Japan a few years ago i tried using google lens on a seasoning at this curry restaurant &amp; it came back as “construction worker” 🤣😅 Hopefully their tech is a little better now. You guys are definitely giving some good tips tho 👍', 'Another tip is wear COMFORTABLE shoes that are made for walking. I’ve traveled to Japan multiple times throughout my life and stick with shoes with a supportive arch/properly designed sole. Also leave the converse sneakers at home as the sole tends to be way too flat.', 'Try not to use google translate cause it can be inaccurate at times, some tend to use DeepL more often or, at times, there are people on youtube who teach basic japanese phrases as well', 'I want to see Japan so badly', 'I just want her shoes!

The town eventually ran out of animals, so they started doing a thing where each day, the king would pick up a card saying a citizen&#39;s name. That citizen would then have to go to the dragon&#39;s cave to be eaten. But one day, it was the princess&#39;s turn to be eaten. When she arrived at the dragon&#39;s cave a prince named &quot;Sant Jordi&quot; appeared. He stabbed the dragon in the heart, killing it. Out of the dragon&#39;s blood roses appeared. Then the prince gave one to the princess. End. So you can buy roses and books that day.']";b'Travel & Events';62175;1811

flower market at kurselya the market is open every morning until around 1pm on Mondays instead of flowers you'll get antiques all day long for a very special lunch you should treat yourself to a meal in one of the many Beach restaurants even in the off season it's warm enough to sit Outdoors as long as the sun is shining we've decided to check out lugely most of the restaurants have similar and pretty reasonable prices you usually get main dishes starting at around 20 euros onion I share a pizza and this awesome artichoke salad with big slices of fresh parmesan and little flowers on top and we have the greatest of times and a perfect view of the sea in our front row seats another experience not to miss is a boat trip between April and October there are daily cruises except for Mondays from nice Harbor to wilforsumeir and back a little later in the season the same company also takes you to can or Santa pay the round trip to Wilford takes an hour and the tour guide tells you lots of interesting facts both in French and English check out what's so special about Bill frosh in this video of ours there are lots of great museums in nice tough choice so how about you pick the most visited one in our department the Shanghai Museum it was inaugurated 50 years ago by Mark Chagall himself after being built according to his own ideas today a French national museum it houses plenty of his characteristic paintings like these in the song of the songs room as well as a stained glass window [Music] and this huge mosaic the auditorium has always been used as a location to bring different Arts together as Mark Chagall had insisted the museum also features a nice Garden Cafe and of course a shop with a large selection of souvenirs with Chagall prints the current anniversary exhibition chagal and me can be visited throughout 2023 when a nice you also want to get a little Provence feeling don't you we suggest you pick one of the many beautiful medieval Villages that are no more than 30 minutes away from nice and enjoy a day in what can feel like a different world as Village which we just showed you and Sample de Vons which you can see now are the most famous and most visited villages on the cortezur so be prepared for big crowds in the summer but trust us take your car or get on a bus to explore at least one of them if you prefer it a little less busy you could also check out to name just a few if you catch a rainy day you can always go and discover the amazing shopping mall called capture meal near the airport but actually even when the weather is nice the

called capsule and almost 50 restaurants and snack bars ensure that you won't want for anything enjoy a break at one of niece's stunning rooftop bars whether you're up for a cup of coffee or a

amazing Panorama of the old town and the huge Park prom night just below the hotel all the way to the Sea granted the drinks aren't cheap but the setting is worth every cent several of nieces hotels

the sea and opposite you can see Monte Carlo with a famous Casino [Music] you can actually walk to the casino if you don't mind a little Marge so let's go down to the harbor first and then ride to the

hotel de Paris Paris which is on a renovation right now and the Beautiful Park opposite the casino if you want to get into the casino go ahead in the mornings it's open for visits starting in the

home to underwater life from the tropical Seas with its clownfish among many others as well as the impressive shark Lagoon you'll see the sweetest most impressive most colorful and other sometimes

air Rehabilitation Basin is their home for as long as it takes for the impressive animals to recover last but not least enjoy a refreshment in the Museum's rooftop Cafe when you go to the princess palace and the oceanographic museum you're already in the middle of Monaco's old town it's called Le roshi since it was built on this massive Rock above the harbor you can wander through the narrow alleys with its souvenir stores and restaurants and you definitely shouldn't miss the cathedral this is where the actress and princes of Monaco Grace Kelly and her husband Prince renier III are buried since Catholicism is the state religion in Monaco the princely family regularly gathers in the cathedral to celebrate important days like the national day and religious festivities the main Harbor is sort of in the middle of it all so you can't miss it and you shouldn't because you get to see big yards with nice names and all kinds of different sizes and colors you'll see the yacht club in the shape of a huge boat swimming pool that becomes a skating rink in the winter fancy car stores and of course the rascus bar in the middle of the curve that plays a big role during the Formula One Grand Prix and above it all Towers the Old Town there are many restaurants around the port so it's easy to sit down and enjoy the views if you're looking for a bargain you can get meals at great prices at the kundamin market just behind the harbor The Market Hall gets really busy at lunchtime [Music] would you have guessed that at the foot of all these skyscrapers and urban Canyons there is a beach well there is and it's a pretty one too if you want to take a break from all the sightseeing just take a dip in the sea or have a drink at one of the various Beach restaurants the new prom that above the beach is also worth a straw the Grimaldi forum is Monaco's major cultural and Convention Center where Top Class events are held regularly this year you'll get to see Monet and full light which shows the work of the impressionist painter Monet and his stays on the French Riviera at a pivotal moment in his life expect to see nearly a hundred paintings from all over the world you would think that Anya and I know nothing about cars and you're probably right but we were truly impressed with the collection of fancy Old-Timers and race cars of different eras beautifully restored and today just play it next to Monica's water sports Stadium at Porter School [Music] it's a very personal collection of some 100 American and European cars that the late Prince Renee started gathering in the 1950s 30 years ago he opened his collection to the public last year it was moved to this Chic new Museum when we arrived some staff were busy moving cows around to provide room for a special exhibition thankfully there were enough cars left to get lost in the history of the automobile the oldest species from 1903 to some pretty recent Formula One race cars and everything in between [Music] it's an impressively intimate collection of vintage Vehicles highlighted by videos Sharing The Prince and his family driving around in some of the cars spanning several decades and it reminds you of how big a roll cars have always played in the principality of Monaco [Music] Annie and I are very fond of the various Coastal paths that are down here at the French Riviera as you might have noticed in previous videos so here's one more you should know about The Salty it's actually in France not in Monaco but for Monaco fonvier it's just a stun's throw away it's a very nicely paved path that offers views of an awesome landscape you could walk all the way to the amazing Beach called pledge De La Mala in about an hour and a half and of course you can stop anytime and return to the departure right next to the principality [Music] for the last pick of our top 10 we thought we'd take you to one of the skyscrapers where some of the illustrious crowd of locals and expats live kind of a look behind the scenes and a real Insider tip for an insanely delicious dinner so follow us to Mona residance newly opened Mona restaurant during the day its residents only and delivery but in the evening it opens for the public you should definitely start your dinner with a selection of medzi to share with your friends before getting a main dish how about the lamb filet with stuffed paquillas and mint yogurt or braised Yellow Tail Carpaccio with a lime cucumber and peanut decoration even a spinach plate with feta cheese and an egg can look this tasty Anna and I love every single dish and even though pretty full we couldn't wait for the dessert serves Mediterranean Cuisine and he literally makes a foray throughout the Mediterranean Basin from Italian Israeli Greek and mcgrabby two local specialties Mauna is an intimate restaurant with a few outdoor tables that offer great privacy and a nice little indoor space prices are totally reasonable for monogask plays so dig right in to get to Monaco we highly recommend the train when you arrive by car be prepared to get stuck in traffic coming down from the motorway and finding your way through the dense development but it's doable once in Monaco pick a parking garage for instance the one below the port or the one below the oceanographic museum you can see a lot of Monaco by just walking or you hop on the little tourist train or to see even more an open top Bass a fun alternative is also one of the red electric bikes as for your cell phone just as a precaution we suggest you turn off data roaming before coming to Monaco friends of ours have recently been charged massive fees for a bit of internet use in the principality thanks for watching did you know we've put together several top 10 films for the French Riviera why don't you check out this one ;1432.8899999999999;1.1864134720739206;36;"['It’s really a wonderful small country I have been there for 2 times really like it', 'Lovely that you also

GhdaXYTV_Rs;b'TOP 27 Things to Do in BERLIN Germany 2023 | Travel Guide';b'Max Nomad';"- In the summer of 2020, I traveled to Berlin in Germany, shortly after the city had
reopened most of its attractions. In this video I want to show you what
visiting Germany is like now and share my top 27 things to do in Berlin during the new normal. (upbeat music) Good morning and welcome to Berlin. We're heading out for the
number one site in Berlin now, which is of course the Brandenburg Gate. (upbeat music) The Brandenburg Gate was commissioned by the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm II and completed in 1791 as a symbol of peace and as an entrance to the grand
boulevard Unter den Linden. The sculpture on top called Quadriga represents the winged god as a victory on a chariot drawn by four horses. Unfortunately, she
wasn't always successful at bringing victory and get kidnapped by Napoleon in 1807 on the returning to
Berlin seven years later, when she was saved by Prussian troops. After the division of Germany, after the Second World War, the gates here became trapped
right behind the Berlin Wall that separated the Eastern and the Western part of the city. And now after the
Reunification Business Symbol or the Reunified Germany and yeah it's really an impressive site. (upbeat music) So here we are now, right
in front of the symbol of the modern German democracy. This is the German parliament, the so-called Reichstag. The Reichstag building
housed the German Parliament from 1894 until 1933, when it burned down under
mysterious circumstances at the beginning of the
Nazi reign in Germany. After the Second World
War, it fell into disuse and was only rebuilt in the 1990s to house parliament of the reunified
Federal Republic of Germany. The glass dome of the Reichstag offers spectacular views of Berlin. (upbeat music) Here we are at the Holocaust Memorial or Memorial to the
murdered Jews of Europe. In my opinion this is definitely one of the most impressive
sites in all of Berlin. Let's take a look inside. Between 1941 and 1945, the German Nazi regime and its collaborators murdered
more than 6 million Jews from all over occupied Europe. The Holocaust Memorial
in the heart of Berlin is Germany's central Memorial
to this unimaginable genocide. (calm music) So now we are inside
the Holocaust Memorial and you might be wondering why are there no written words anywhere? Why are there no stars of David,
for example, those symbols? Well, it's all about
the feeling that you get when wandering around in this field here and the feeling you get is
really like kind of a sense of being disoriented, lost and this feels really
dehumanizing in a way, like all this cold concrete around you. And this is exactly the
feeling that the artist, Peter Eisenman, who
designed this memorial, wanted you to have. (calm music) If you want more information
about the Holocaust, you can visit the excellent
information center situated under the Holocaust Memorial. And here I am at the most
important non monument, if you wanna call it that in Berlin. This is the site of the führer bunker where Adolf Hitler found shelter before he killed himself in 1945 and there is nothing here. As you can see it's a parking lot. Germany doesn't really know
what to do with this site, obviously it has a super dark history and yeah the bukler is
underground obviously and you can't really see it but this is a very historic place. (upbeat music) So, we are now at Potsdamer Platz. This square was once part
of the border between East and West Germany. So it's completely inaccessible and rebuilding the square was one of the most ambitious
architectural projects of the 1990s and I think the result was spectacular. Today Potsdamer Platz
has a lots of offices, theaters, cinemas, hotels,
apartments and museums. One of the architectural
highlights of the areas, the Sony Center, with
its 10-flight glass roof and a pretty good favoring plaza. The Sony Center also
features the popular Museum of Film and Television. So now I'm gonna find a scooter and then we're gonna head
over to Checkpoint Charlie. (upbeat music) By walking it would've
taken me around 19 minutes from the Potsdamer Platz to
here, to the Checkpoint Charlie and now with escooter was just 6 minutes, it's amazing. So these scooters open up
a world of possibilities that you can save so much time. I highly recommend taking
them if you are traveling to Berlin. Here we are at the Checkpoint Charlie, that was once the most
important checkpoint between the two Berlins. I'm in the Soviet sector and the American sectors
are right there behind me. You can see the portrait
of an American soldier. We're in the Soviet sectors, so the American soldiers
looking into the Soviet sector and then on the other side where I'm in the former American sector, you would see the portrait
of a Soviet soldier looking into the American sector. So yeah, this is a potent
symbol of the cold war. And for a brief moment in 1961, American and Soviet tanks faced off here during what became known
as the Berlin Crisis, getting the world close
to a third world war but luckily this never happened. (upbeat music) So after a quick scooter ride, we're now on Museumsinsel, Museum Island. This island has several
amazing art museums and it also has one of the
most important churches of Berlin. This is the Berlin Cathedral, the Belina dome, Berlin Cathedral, from 1905, was the largest protestant
church in Germany. Commissioned by the last German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II, it was severely damaged
during the Second World War and only partly rebuild afterwards. The church's basement houses
the Hohenzollern crypt, which is the final resting place of 94 members of Germany's
former royal family. (upbeat music) So we are now climbing
up to the viewing point, to the dome of the cathedral. It's 269 steps, if I remember correctly, so it might take a while. (upbeat music) So I think the climb up
here is definitely worth it. Check out the view, it's amazing. (upbeat music) And here we are in one of the most
beautiful squares of Berlin, this is the Gendarmenmarkt, named after a regiment of French refugees that were fighting in the Prussian army in the 18th century. And it is a beautiful square
with two big cathedrals, French cathedral and a German cathedral and it also has the concert house, a big concert hall,
really beautiful square. (upbeat music) For dinner, I decided to head over to the
Augustiner am Gendarmenmarkt which is a popular Bavarian restaurant right next to the square. Of course I got the proper German beer and it was one liter. It's not really pure beer though, I got beer mixed with lemonade 'cause I still need to do a lot of sightseeing for you tomorrow but cheers guys. Food arrived and I ordered a really traditional Southern German dish, this is Schweinebraten
mit Kartoffel Kloesse so roasted pork with dumplings and a dark beer sauce. It looks really good. (upbeat music) I'm starting the day off today with a nice German breakfast
here at the bäckereias, the bakery. I got a piece of cake and the so called, rosinenschnecke, which is a baked pastry with frosting and it looks super good. (upbeat music) So now here we are at the
Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer, the Berlin Wall Memorial. The wall was built almost
exactly on this day, 59 years ago in 1961, to keep the German
citizens of Eastern Germany locked into their own country because so many of them
had escaped to the West. Between 1949 and 1961
socialist East Germany, the so-called GDR lost 3.6 million people, that immigrated to Western Germany looking for a better life. A number so high that it put the GDR on the brink of collapse. In a desperate attempt
to stop the immigration, the GDR government decided
to lock its population into the country by constructing a four to five border system and giving it's soldiers strict orders to shoot anyone who would try to cross it. (upbeat music) So here we are at the Window
of Remembrances in Memorial to the brave people who lost their lives trying to escape from the GDR. And what's really shocking
about this Memorial is that a lot of these
people are really young. Some are only children and they still lost their life
trying to cross the border. Many of them were shot or they drowned or got
killed in other ways while trying to cross the wall or the German fortified border and yeah, it's a really moving memorial here at the Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer. (upbeat music) Other important parts of
the Berlin Wall Memorial are a 70 meter long reconstructed
section of the board of fortifications, Documentation Center and the Modern Chapel of Reconciliation. (upbeat music) So it's time for the most
iconic dish from Berlin that's of course, currywurst and it looks so delicious. I'm here at the Kaonnopke's Imbiss, one of the best place to get it, let's try it. So good, it's great, this is excellent. After lunch I stopped for a quick drink next to River Spree and I got myself and
other berliner weisse. This is the version with woodruff and it's green as you can see. The berliner weisse is a refreshing, slightly sour beer that is usually served with either green woodruff
or red raspberry syrup. Let's try it. (upbeat music) It's really nice and refreshing, like the taste is kind of sweet, mixed with the beer, a little
bit sour, really tasty. All right, as you can see,
we're next to the river, next to the spree, as
it's called in German and we're gonna do a little
boats tour for one hour. I think it's gonna be really cool. Let's go on a river cruise
around Museum Island. (upbeat music) I really enjoyed this relaxing tour of the center of Berlin, that covered many famous sites like the Berlin Cathedral, the TV tower, the Reichstag
and the Chancellor's Office. Most boats leave on the
eastern side of Museum Island, close to the GDR Museum. The boat company I used was
called Reederei Hadynski. I'll include a link to the company and all the other sites
that I mentioned this video in the description below. (upbeat music) And I'm crossing the bridge
to get back to Museumsinsel, Museum Island and you're gonna visit the neues
museum, the new museum now, with one really famous exhibit. Together with the equally
famous Pergamonmuseum the neues museum is the main
attraction of Museum Island. Its undisputed star is a 3,300 year old bust of the eternally beautiful
Egyptian, Queen Nefertiti. The museum also features lots
of other Egyptian sculptures and prehistoric artifacts, like the 3000 year old Berlin gold hat, which is covered in astrological symbols and might have helped ancient priests calculate the movements
of the sun and moon. (upbeat music) So here we are in the most
famous square of Berlin, this is Alexanderplatz, it's the very heart of Berlin, there're lots of shopping
malls around here and it's super busy every day. Once the most important
square of East Berlin, Alexanderplatz, is today
the most visited area after Reunified City and one of the busiest
squares in all of Europe. Shopping options on the square include the giant Alexa Shopping Mall and a big Galeria
Kaufhof department store. And now I'm at a really
famous landmark of Berlin, this is the Weltzeituhr, the world clock. It can be used to determine the local time in 148 cities around the world. And then it was already time for dinner. (upbeat music) So, I'm here now at the Braufactum, which is a craft beer and burger place. I got this Colonia summer beer and it's really tasty. Cheers. So good, this is the
(inaudible) burger, so nice and sweet potato fries. (upbeat music) Next I meet up with my good friend, Jesco, to go for a typical Berlin style bar hall. (upbeat music) We're at the Kottbusser Tor now, the Berliners call it Kotti, it's a great place for going out, there's lots of bars and the cool thing is
Jesco used to live here. So do you know maybe a cool
place where we could go? - Let's go to this region called the bars. - Excellent. (upbeat music) So we walked around a little bit we found this really nice
craft beer bar called Biererei and we got a nice local
beer called kirsch weisse. (upbeat music) After checking out a few more bars we walked over to the Admiralsbrücke. (upbeat music) So I lost count of how
many beers I've had today but it's probably gotta be the last one, it's the Berliner kindl radler. So once again beer mixed with lemonade and I must say this bridge
is a super nice place so thanks to Jesco for recommending it and yeah I think this is a
great second night in Berlin so cheers and then I'll
see you again tomorrow. Good night guys. (upbeat music) All right, so today
we're taking the s-bahn to get to the first site. Public transport in Berlin is super quick and reliable is really
one of the best ways to get around the city. (upbeat music) So we are today in one of
my all time favorite sites in Berlin. This is the East Side Gallery. It's the largest open air
mural art gallery in the world. The way this came to be is in 1989 the wall finally came to an end. It was opened and
destroyed for the most part but 1.3 kilometers of
wall were preserved here and painted by international artists and it's so beautiful, such a nice place to discover in a warm sunny afternoon like today and that's what we're gonna do right now, so let's check out the East Side Gallery. (upbeat music) A lot of the murals of
the East Side Gallery are quite political and express ideas of
freedom, peace and tolerance. Some of the most famous ones
are Vrubel's satiric depiction of the fraternal kiss between GDR and Soviet leaders Honecker and Brezhnev, Alavi's ""It happened in November"", Noir's ""Homage to the Young"" and Klingenstein's ""Detour
to the Japanese Sector"". And this is another really
famous mural by Birgit Kinder and it shows a Trabant, quite
a typical Houston driven car, breaking through the
Berlin wall into freedom and the license plate reads
9th of November, 1989, which is the date of the
fall of the Berlin Wall. (upbeat music) I took the s-bahn to Charlottenburg and decided to have
another very typical dish from Berlin for lunch. And now we're at a place that a lot of people say
is Berlin's best kebap. All right, let's see if that's true. It's called SuperHahn. (upbeat music) Ah, this kebab looks so good and doner, as you would say in German, is so nice. It looks so good and fresh. (upbeat music) Oh, wow, mhmm, this is delicious and so good, you can
really tell it's fresh, high-quality ingredients, so happy, it's delicious. (upbeat music) And we made it, this is
Schloss Charlottenburg or Charlottenburg Palace in English. It's the former residents
of the Prussian Kings, Prussia played a leading rule
in the unification of Germany in the 19th century and this was a castle of the Royal family. (upbeat music) The palace's most beautiful rooms are the private quarters
of King Frederick the Great in the new wing. They include the white Hall banquet room and the Golden Gallery, a rococo fantasy of mirrors
and golden decorations. It's truly magnificent castle, just a little bit sad that
it's run to be the empty because a lot of the decorations and fringe has been lost
in the Second World War but nonetheless, it's beautiful. You can really imagine what life must have been like here
during the 18th Century. (upbeat music) Other attractions of the palace include the more somber winter chambers, the baroque old palace and the palace park, which is perfect for a
long stroll in summer. (upbeat music) And now I'm here in front of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche, this was once a magnificent church but during a bombing in 1943, it was almost completely destroyed and the leftovers serve as
a anti war memorial today, it's pretty impressive and definitely worth a visit. After its destruction
during the Second World War, the remains of the
Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche were stabilized and then in 1960s, a modern
octagonal hall of worship and a bell tower were added. (upbeat music) So, I'm now walking down the
so-called Kurfürstendamm, which is one of the most famous
shopping streets in Berlin, it's really beautiful, lots and lots of shops. So if you're into shopping this is definitely the
place for you in Berlin. (upbeat music) And we're gonna start our
day off really sweet today with a trip to Ritter
Sport Bunte Schokowelt. Ritter Sport is my favorite
kind of chocolate from Germany. I think this is gonna be amazing, let's take a look inside the shop. (upbeat music) The Ritter Sport Bunte Schokowelt acts as a fun flagship
store for Ritter Sport and its most famous products. The colorful square
100 gram chocolate bars that are available in
seemingly infinite varieties. I even had a chance to
create my own chocolate at the entrance. You can select the ingredients and then they prepare it fresh for you, so I'm really excited to
see how that will turn out. (upbeat music) And there he's looking for
my self designed chocolate. (upbeat music) And then it was finally time to taste my self-designed
Ritter Sport chocolate bar. So it has pepper, gummy
bears and M&M's and wow. I took an escooter to get
to my next destination. (upbeat music) And now I'm standing in the middle of one of the
biggest inner city parks in the world, this is the Tiergarten and right there behind me is
one of the major landmarks of Berlin, this is the Siegessäule, with the golden winged guard
as a victory at the top. The Berliners called her Goldelse and yeah, let's go for a
little walk around the park, I think it's gonna be really
nice to discover it some more. (upbeat music) And behind me, you can see the
original purpose of the park, it used to be the preferred hunting ground for the Prussian kings. Later on, it was converted
into a public park and that is what it
still serves as to date. (upbeat music) And now I'm standing in front
of the biggest shopping mall in continental Europe, this is the Kadewe or Kaufhaus
des Westens in German. It is huge and it also
has a legendary food court on the sixth floor which is great timing
'cause I'm really hungry. So let's get inside and check out what's in store for us at the Kadewe. (upbeat music) Here we are, this is
the legendary food hall. (upbeat music) I decided to have lunch here and I was in the mood
for some Japanese food to mix things up a little. I'm gonna have some delicious sushi now. (upbeat music) Yeah, that was truly a fantastic meal and now I'm gonna maybe look around a little more here in the shops and then I'll catch my train to Prague. (upbeat music) So those are my

It was such a  powerful experienced to visit the once off-limits STASI HQ and walk the halls of the secret police and observe the many personal accounts about life under the oppressive GDR.

KuJwC9gTYhw;b'INDIA travel guide | EVERYTHING to know before you go';b'Rhett and Claire';if you are planning to go to India one day don't even hesitate and book your flights we had an incredible month in India the food was Unreal the people were amazing and the history and architecture was just mind-blowing if you're planning a trip to India or have always had an interest in visiting India then look no further this video covers everything you need to know about traveling to India [Music] thank you foreign sport budgets how to pay for things what to pack apps needed scammed what to do what not to do and a whole lot more we absolutely loved our time there and can 100 recommend it you just have to be aware of a few if you find this video helpful in any way we'd really appreciate it if you consider giving it a like and subscribing for more videos like this let's start this video off with how to get to India India is big and there are a few different international airports you can fly into daily Mumbai and Bangalore are the biggest and see the most international flights we chose to fly to Delhi in the north of India because they had the cheapest direct flights we were also trying to avoid the hot and humid rainy season in the South and it is the start of the touristy Golden Triangle route that we did use Google flights to see what flights are available now let's touch on visas we applied for an electronic online visa you go to the website listed here and it's really just quite an easy process as of November 2022 175 countries are eligible for a 30-day Visa we're South Africans so we got that for free otherwise it is 25 USD if you don't qualify for the free Visa just make sure you apply for your e-visa at least two weeks before you try travel using this link down below there's a lot of holidays in India and that can actually affect how long it takes to get to your Visa so make sure you're applying in advance our Visa took seven working days and we printed it out to show to immigration at the airport covered requirements because we went before the latest update which occurred in November we had to show our proof of vaccination right now on the website you can check more information about it here at least that you are preferably supposed to be vaccinated but I don't think it's an actual requirement anymore but you can read more about that on this website once again or you can go to safety Wings borderless website and tap on India and see what the latest requirements are they are often updating that website it's a really good resource to use if you're traveling anywhere in the world no proof of accommodation or outward flight was needed but we did book one just in case next section is currency the currency in India is Indian rupees about one dollar will get you approximately 82 rupees with that you can pay for a short ride in a tuck tuck buy a couple of drinks at a Mart or a bowl of Maggie noodles things are quite affordable but more on that later while on the topic of currency our number one tip is to make sure you've got a good amount of cash on you so either draw money as you land in the airport or convert your foreign currency there we say this because it'll save you a lot of headaches trying to find working and legitimate ATMs outside of the airport in our personal experience we had a really hard time finding working ATMs and cash was actually really needed for us we needed it all the time half the ATMs just simply didn't accept my credit card and I had the same thing at points of sale about half or if not more of the points of sale vendors would not accept our credit card even though I have a USD credit card on the Apple pay front we found it worked at places like Starbucks and proper establishments but it didn't work at a lot of the local Indian stores what Indian vendors will use is something called upis which is like your tap to scan or your QR code payment methods we were unable to apply for that we tried paytm we tried Google pay we tried multiple methods but they just did not accept our International credit card we found that you actually need to have an Indian bank account or an Indian phone number to be able to sign up for these things which makes it a little difficult for international Travelers paying for things was probably one of our biggest struggles in India so be prepared for that in conclusion just make sure you have cash because a lot of vendors still do accept cash next up best time to visit India the best time to visit India is in the winter between December and March the whole country tends to get very hot from April onwards and most regions in India experience the Summer monsoon from June July August and September the good thing about traveling a bit later in the year is that it's Festival season in India Diwali is in October or November it changes every year Independence Day was in August that was awesome holy festival is in March and there's tons more in between I think going to India during the festival period is so awesome you should definitely plan your travels around those times we visited from mid-august to mid-september the temperature was ranging between 30 and 35 degrees in Delhi it was actually very hot during the day so if you're going to be traveling at that time of the year prepare to get quite sweaty if you go in the summer we would recommend visiting the northern regions where it's a little bit cooler next up what to pack firstly we highly recommend traveling to India with either a small carry-on or a hiking backpack that's going to make your life a hell of a lot easier especially if you plan to use buses or trains for transport in that bag pack the following once are wrong to cover up from stairs and from the Sun you can pack another one just in case the first one gets dirty second of all pack breathable loose-fitting clothing that covers your bum chest shoulders and legs next walking shoes that you're prepared to get dirty iPad sandals but I she didn't wear them at all I wore clothes shoes instead the ground is a bit dirty and dusty so it's just best to wear clothes shoes next is diarrhea medication for runny tummy cramps and vomiting but the pharmacies in India are amazing and you can find all of that there next up is thrush medication if you are a lady prone to uids because it's hot and sweaty but that applies to all hot parts of the world next up enough female Sanitary products they are hard to get if you use a specific type this once again applies to every single country like even Indonesia so yeah pack those for yourself I've said enough where it can carry on with the list next up we recommend you bring a lot of rehydrates and protein bars because India is largely vegetarian especially up in the north there's quite a shortage of meat so you're going to need a bit of protein in your diet good protein next up which we found we could not do with that is eye drops and nose spray it gets very dusty and dry up in the north so bring those if you do forget them though pharmacies in India have got you covered and the hospitals are amazing by the way but more on that later next up a plug adapter as always these are what the plugs look like in India we're South African though so we did not need an adapter next up bring proper mosquito repellent there were quite a lot of mosquitoes in Delhi actually everywhere in India that we went even in ladakh next up is something I'm pretty passionate about is pack your anxiety meds if you are prone to getting anxious around loud and busy scenarios because India is very loud [Music] my anxiety gets triggered by loud sounds so I had a bit of a hard time Brady also over here started forming anxiety so the doctors in India prescribed them anxiety medications too then if you plan going up to the Himalayan regions definitely bring your warm winter clothes it can smell up there depending on the time of the year it's another storm in India late September so we have Payway jackets and thermals and we pretty much just put that under like warm-ish clothing just lay it up if you're based in Delhi or maybe perhaps the coastal areas then you can just pack your normal summer attire do make sure like I mentioned before that you're covering certain areas if you're a female and actually men too like you have to cover your knees and your legs if you're going into certain temples and mosques but on most days just walking around daily I did just wear t-shirts and shorts with a pair of sneakers the don't worry if you forget anything though India has amazing malls with h M's and Birkenstocks and Sephoras we don't even have Sephora in South Africa they have everything you'll be totally fine next up apps to download zomato this we use to order food to our house it's basically like Uber Eats in India next up is Uber we found that to be the most reliable and really good for Intercity travel another one like uber is Ola which is also a Ride e-hailing app then paytm is the next one if you can get it working I would highly recommend getting it because we're going to make your life a hell of a lot easier to pay for things in India it didn't work for us though next one is obviously going to be Google Maps make sure you download the maps for offline mode this was super helpful if you ever run out of internet connection when we travel we use Google Maps for everything from navigation to reviewing good restaurants and coffee shops in an area that we're in next up is my trip this app is golden you can book anything from flights buses trains it's brilliant and it takes international cards so make sure you download the app and add your payment method it's going to save you a lot of headaches we even booked our flights to Layla duck from South Africa using the app it is highly recommended next up the Airtel app if you do get a SIM card and want to top up and check your data usage but more on that later booking.com we always have it downloaded it's super easy to book your accommodation and have all your reservations saved all in one app so get that and finally download the zostel app they also have a really good website it's used for booking unique stays across India and it's also the world's largest Backpacker chain next up accommodation India is huge and the sheer amounts of different types of accommodation reflects that you can do anything from a seven dollar hostel to a 400 a night luxury resort I'm pretty sure I read that India has the most amount of seven star hotels that's pretty darn impressive as the average Traveler book we set mainly in hostels in Homestay days and in like 60 dollar hotels we found airbnbs weren't really a thing we didn't even use the Airbnb app we used booking.com to book all of our accommodation and we stayed with friends as well thank you Auntie and Uncle for having us the only accommodation option I really struggled to find were co-working and co-living spaces I'm sure they exist but I had a very hard time finding them therefore we didn't even stay in them if you're a digital Nomad like us it's a really good option wherever you are in the world to look for co-living spaces because they've got workspaces really good internet and just like-minded people are staying there so you can make really good friends for all the links to the accommodations that we stayed in check the link in the description to buy our India resource pack and itinerary all of the accommodation options will be in that there's so much included in that resource pack such as our favorite guides numbers and where to hire motorbikes as well as our Google Map link which I think is golden next up is transport and this honestly was the best part about India it was so much fun as discussed earlier Uber and Ola are going to be your e-hailing apps we highly recommend you use these because a lot of the drivers actually might not speak English and it just becomes a bit of a nightmare trying to navigate and tell somebody where you want to go so that's why if you use Uber they already know where to go and using these apps will also help you avoid being taken advantage of some of the taxi drivers are part of elaborate tourist scams so just trying to avoid that situation altogether but more about scans a little bit later another awesome thing about Uber is that they have so many different types of transport they've got tick-tuk rides that you can order they've got luxury cars they've got normal cars and they've got inter-city drivers that can drive you from Delhi to Jaipur or Jaipur to aggro it's super easy all in one app we just highly recommend using Uber and then one more is actually blue which our friend told us about it's a basically an electronic vehicle version of uber we didn't get to try it but I think you should check it out next up trains they were amazing they are the best way to get around India so much fun it added to the experience of being in India they are different types of trains that you can choose you can go on one dollar trains or you can do the premium kind of ones that we did they were amazing you get snacks and wool hot tea and blankets and the people are funny oh my goodness you have to use the trains this is probably the best way that we got around to have a smooth amazing training experience we recommend that you get first or second AC class trains they are not expensive at all and they are wonderful also we use very good brands that were recommended by our friends they were the ranjani express and express or something like that for more information about the trains go watch this video it's quite a fun one I actually really like this video so yeah go watch this linked above all right flights flights around the country were accessible and reasonably priced a flights of about two hours from daily to lay cost us around about fifty dollars we booked all of our flights using esmytrip.com we even used the website to book trains it is highly recommended in our train video you'll see we explained how we had a difficult time booking train tickets using the standard Government website so is my trip made things a hell of a lot easier for us if you're in Agro we found a lot of tourists or tour guides which would book the trains for you you just take your cash straight to them again another reason why you need cash and they'll help you book your train tickets all across India the reason for this is that a lot of the government sites or Indian Run sites do not accept foreign cards motorbikes a lot of cool cats like to ride like Royal Enfield cool air spikes around India it's a thing even the Indian people love to do it they arrive from Delhi all the way to ladakh in the north it's super cool it's definitely for The Adventurous and brave people though because some of the roads are crazy but yeah that's another option if you want you can hire one in Delhi or we have our motorbike rental place in ladakh down in the resource pack below motorbike hire in Lair was 1800 rupees per day but apparently it's a lot cheaper in the bigger cities if you don't want to take public transport then definitely organize yourself a private driver Avis has a private chauffeur option that you can order on their website otherwise our favorite drivers details will be linked in the resource pack all right cars you might want to hire a car and drive around yourself but the locals are actually hesitant to hire cars out to foreigners we wouldn't even recommend it at all we tried to rent our own car in the dark to drive it around but they really wouldn't let us and I think that's because the driving in India is very different and foreigners probably might mess up the cars and stuff so it's definitely not common for Foreigner to rent a car in India probably the most common transport method in India is the Tuk Tuk and you can held down one pretty much on every street in India and it roughly costs you about 50 to 100 rupees for 18 to 20 minute drive next up is budget how much should you can safely say India was one of the most affordable countries we've ever visited probably Thai with Vietnam for one month in India we spent 2500 USD for two people and majority of that were spent in ladakh in the north that was quite an expensive trip for us as South Africans transport was quite expensive food everything of all was more expensive there and we spent 10 days in the duck if you're staying in places like Delhi Agra Jaipur it is much cheaper than that so you can definitely spend way less than 2 500 for two people we would say that's pretty good though we moved around a lot every few days lots of transportation we saw everything we wanted to see we ate all the food we didn't actually skimp on any of the pricing probably the hostels we did try and save a little bit of money on accommodation because obviously if you're spending a hundred dollars a night on a hotel you're gonna spend three thousand dollars alone on accommodation so we didn't want to do that to 2500 for two people in India it's pretty darn good looking at our personal expenses we spent approximately eighty dollars per day for two people that includes accommodation food transport entry into all of our sites that we wanted to visit absolutely everything not a bad deal but let's break down some of the prices if you're a Backpacker you can spend as little as 15 to 40 dollars a day you'll be able to because we stayed in the seven Dollar Hotel the one night next up if you're a comfortable traveler similar to how we are you'll be spending 40 to 80 a day and then finally luxury dude there is no limit to how luxurious you can be in India they are unbelievable places you can stay at you can do private train experiences like Cara and Native for what ten thousand dollars a night or something crazy it's the luxury in India is next level so I don't even want to put a number on the luxury but anything above I'd say 200 a day is pretty luxurious good value for money though even 100 a day I'd say is pretty luxurious if you want to check out a nice Heritage Hotel I will link the video above we splurged the one night next up is traffic insane like insane Next Level 12 Lanes worth of traffic bumper to bumper cars so if you're traveling by Road or in cars or anything on the road it'll take you a lot longer than you expected to a lot of recommendations came from our comments to use the Metro System we didn't actually get to use it but maybe you would like to check it out apparently it's very efficient to move around daily at least yeah I think it would be better to use a much other than to use cards because it does take longer short and it's loud it's so loud guys the hooting oh my goodness the beeping you know what else makes the traffic bad in India it's the cows they just walk and roam on the highways by themselves it was so cute oh I loved India and the cows and yeah it's all fun it's so much fun next up language and culture the locals speak Hindi and most speak fluent English actually so except for the odd driver Hotel staff and some of the older generation but we got by pretty easily with English Hindi is a pretty cool language to learn though it's awesome to hear it I think the only words we learned were Namaste and yeah we really didn't need to learn Hindi though everyone spoke English in terms of religion and culture Hinduism literally originated from India so it is the most common religion we came across and the reason why so many people are vegetarian although India is a Hindu majority country they also have a big Muslim population they have Buddhism they have Christian Christianity all sorts India is one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse countries in the world you will be surprised when you travel all around India you'll learn so much it's amazing and they practice their religion solidly next up is where to go India is so big that we were overwhelmed and completely confused as to where to go but some people suggested the Golden Triangle tourist route to us lots of blog posts and supervisors have the same so we went with it our friends wanted to visit ladakh for the first time so we added that on too maybe head down to the comment section and our Indian followers can guide you a little more as to where you want to go we were pretty happy with the Golden Triangle Roots although we would like to see more raw authentic Indian culture a lot of the areas we visited were very touristy but it is the Tourist route it a lot of people didn't agree with us doing the Golden Triangle and I totally agree it is such a small little area of India I'm glad we ended up going to ladakla that was further away and we saw a different part of India although the history and architecture in each city is amazing we do recommend the Golden Triangle we're not saying don't do it we're just saying if you are going to do it try do somewhere else like Goa or Varanasi or ladat like we did as well as the Golden Triangle but for first-timers like us it was great we had a good time we had a great little Taste of India and we loved ladakh for our whole itinerary and what we did in India you can check the link in the description once again all right next up is what to eat oh the food is the best part it's just as amazing as you can imagine it to be some of our favorites are filmy I mean the desserts were really good so here's some of our favorites on the list just eat all of these when you're in India paneer kulfi chapati Dosa Paratha Tikka chicken gulab jamun biryani here idli rice cakes and there are so many vegetarian meals if you're vegetarian or even vegan you'll be sorted we come from South Africa so we're very used to Indian food although it's very different actually in India majority of these things we just mentioned are vegetarian you're mainly eating vegetarian food while in India there are lots of Western food options as well you can use the zomato app in order to your house an average meal in India will cost you around two to three dollars and you can go to very nice restaurants and spend a lot more a lot more yeah one thing to definitely not doing in India is eat seafood oh this will happen it really knocked me out for like 10 days which was very unfortunate next up is water and ice pretty much nobody who drinks tap water we all just use bottled water while in India and we also avoided ice for that reason definitely don't brush your teeth with tap water it's pretty much the same as barley the locals might be used to the tap water but foreigners certainly aren't so just avoid it just in case bottled waters were supplied on the long train rides which was really convenient we didn't have to pay for this bottle of water which is cool it's readily available in most Marts and restaurants so you don't really need to worry about it if you are staying at a Homestay or hotel they will order these big 25 liter bottles of water so you sorted next up is alcohol we didn't actually drink a stitch of alcohol while we were in India it just actually didn't really come up we found it kind of hard to find alcohol places it wasn't really sold at restaurants or in the Mars like it is in Bali you can seek it out they are these specific bottle stores which we saw in the daily area so you can and get alcohol and wine and those sorts of things but it's just not a very common thing aren't really even comments on the pricing line [Music] you're not going there to be partying and stuff unless you're probably in Goa it's not really a topic that you even entertain you just have fun sober and enjoy seeing the sights and stuff and eating the food next up travel insurance and medical travel insurance is definitely not a requirement to enter India but it is highly recommended at least we think so this is if you get hospitalized and you have a serious accident it might be quite expensive and you'll want to be covered but we can say after visiting the hospital three times in India that it is so affordable we went to private International hospitals the doctor only costs rates ten dollars for consultation and he had a full full body health check 11 steps all sorts of tests and that was 73. 73 dollars so just a small visit to the doctor you'll be totally fine to cover it yourself but if it's a bigger thing then definitely have travel insurance now pharmacies they are really really good in India too stuff is very very affordable and they're all over the place you can even get antibiotics over the counter without seeing a doctor in India don't even worry about the medical in India they have some of the best doctors in the world they are super knowledgeable and they will take care of you we even know a few people that come specifically to India to do dentistry and other medical related things it's actually quite a popular thing to do in Delhi they even have a medical Visa that you can there's a medical Visa there's specific hospitals for tourists and hotels for tourists to stay at when they come to get their medical procedures done in India there's like a whole setup about it brilliant next up is vaccinations we always talk to our travel doctor before we visit a place and we were advised to get Hepatitis A and B shots and typhoid shots before going to India specifically we would also recommend the rabies vaccinations in case you end up getting scratched or bitten by a monkey or a dog laughs I just got bitten by a dog in Bali Indonesia and had to do the four course rabies vaccinations wasn't really fun but it could have all been avoided if we did get vaccinated beforehand it can be quite stressful trying to get those shots in a foreign country they are quite rare to find and hard to find even in Bali a tourist destination so yeah if you're worried about rabies and things like that then probably get vaccinated before you leave your home country next up is the length of stay the length of stay really actually depends on you you do get a 30-day tourist visa and that was more than enough time for us if you don't have a lot of time maybe 10 to 14 days is good enough you can do the whole Golden Triangle and maybe one or two other places as well but if you want to travel the entire of India that'll take you about 10 years to do India is massive there are so many different amazing places to see good luck travel planning and figuring out where you want to go it's tough there's a lot it's we definitely need to go back a couple more times to see all the places we'd love to go we'd have to probably buy more trips to cover all right next up is the electricity and plugs that they use India uses the same plug system as South Africa at least the two-prong version of that so we were able to plug in our phone charges and everything directly into the plugs in India without needing an adapter but these adapters are pretty cheap grab one before you leave or you can even get one in India itself there were plugged on the trains in most starbuckses and we basically didn't have a problem getting a charge whenever we needed next up is SIM card and internet we suggest getting a SIM card as soon as you land in the airport and get them to set it up for you and load a good amount of data on it we say that because the app didn't actually work for us afterwards and to try and load data on the app ourselves was quite difficult if you do it at the airport you're sorted if you don't happen to do it at the airport then definitely get a local friend or a hotel to help you in terms of Wi-Fi speed the Wi-Fi was a bit of a hit or miss like we got really good speeds up to 200 megabytes per second in some of the places we stayed on average it was about 50 and then sometimes strangely in the Starbucks is we got two megabytes per second so it can be quite variable we relied on mobile data a tan and luckily data is very affordable in India and the LTE signals are pretty darn good although when you go to ladakh in India they use a totally different system so your sim card actually doesn't work have to buy a new one in ladakh or just rely on the Wi-Fi is there next up International driving permits this is something you only need to get if you plan to hire a motorbike I'd say like we said renting a car isn't recommended so get it if you need it's basically just your own choice you pretty much won't need it though next up is now tipping is not actually actually quiet or kind of experience so generally when we would agree with a guide or a driver on a certain price they would finish the job or whatever and then at the end they would kind of guilt-trip you into paying them a little bit more so yeah whatever price you agree with someone doesn't necessarily mean it's the end price you will kind of be expected to pay a little bit more we found in restaurants and things was kind of already worked into the receipt um so you don't have to tap there in terms of the amount you're wanting to tip that's really up to you a little bit goes a long way you can be as generous as you want next up is laundry we'll cover this quickly we basically did it at the guest houses and the hostels it is Affordable they don't charge you an arm and a leg if you're wanting to do laundry and your accommodation doesn't offer it just ask this off they are so helpful they'll organize a laundromat for you and it can be done in the day quick sticks one load of laundry shouldn't cost you more than 10 to 15 dollars it's super duper affordable all right next up is weather and natural disasters India has floods and landslides and that's pretty much the only natural disasters that we would worry about is especially if you're planning to drive a motorbike around the country that could be very dangerous especially since a lot of the roads are still very Sandy so avoid the monsoon season from April to September if that scares you otherwise if you are sticking to the big cities as a tourist you don't need to worry about any other natural disasters now the part that most of you would probably appreciate is what to skip in India we love doing these two just to inform you a bit more about things that you shouldn't even waste your money and time on first of all this is yeah this is interesting in Delhi this is one of the biggest Spice markets in the whole of Asia and it's where a lot of tourists in uh that's where we saw the most tourists in India a lot of tour companies operate tours to this Chinese market and at first we were all excited about it it was a new experience it was cool to go there but after we posted the video and we received a lot of comments about how local Indian people just don't believe that tourists should even be going to Parts like this because it's not even a reflection of India it's very run down it's very busy and chaotic and it's quite dirty I also feel I agree with the people in the comments because it's not a good reflection on India or Delhi there's something strange about tourists going to go and view this place to do what you want with that information it's up to you whether you want to go to China and have a tick-tuk driver take you through there at the end of the day it's your choice as a tourist but a lot of the local Indians don't think it's a good place for tourists to go next thing to skip is probably spend we spend more than one night in Agra as where the Taj Mahal is and the Taj Mahal is gorgeous the grounds around there are amazing but the city around there is quite run down dirty and chaotic and there's really not much else other than the Taj Mahal and agrofort to see you can totally cover Agra in one night it's more than enough time next up is a trip to tomariri this we would not recommend if you do come from a country like Canada or New Zealand and you are used to seeing these incredible big mountains all around you if you are not from a country like that and you'd love to see the beautiful lakes and mountains we highly recommend it it was a beautifully Scenic trip we're from South Africa and we have nothing like it in our country so to see snow-capped mountains and Blue Lakes and mirror reflections of mountains and stuff was incredible but doobie warned the trip is brutal you're on bumpy roads in the car for hours and hours altitude sickness is also very real so if you're an adventurous type and you've never seen landscape shapes like that definitely do it if you're from a beautiful place like we said before skip that one and finally we think that you should skip Amber Fort unless you have a local guide to take you there so don't do amber fort on your own this is one of the only places in India that we were seriously harassed and we actually wanted to leave but it is so beautiful there too so make sure you've got a local guide and if you don't have one then don't go because it will be a bad experience for you if you want to see our full experience at Amber Fort then check this video linked above next up is things we recommend you do first one is diaper pink City we loved diaper the architecture the things you can do there the people the food and we particularly love the homes that we stayed in in Draper as well it was overall just an amazing experience being in that City we mentioned it already in the previous section but we highly recommend you visit the Taj Mahal one or two nights is more than enough in Agri though a lot of people commenting on the video saying that there's more incredible little historical sites in India than the Taj Mahal but it honestly was one of the most beautiful buildings within you have to see and the grounds and the sunrise it was just amazing then literally one of the most favorite cities we've ever been to is Le we highly recommend if you can go visit lit go and watch the videos if you're planning to go to India definitely plan a trip to LIT we fell in love with it so much that we could see ourselves living in Leia for a couple of months yeah and finally something we didn't actually do ourselves but we're pretty bummed we missed out on it is either dharamsala or in ladakh if you're a fan of the the layalama then definitely go and see his teachings in ladakh or dharansala it's something we actually didn't even know happened until we got to India so if you're a fan of them check out his teachings obviously there are tons more places to visit in India we've heard really good things about Goa Varanasi Mumbai and Bangalore you'll just have to check out other YouTubers for more info on those places and see which one tickles your scent s next up is safety well really different video on this topic but we can straight up tell you that India and Indian people are some of the most incredible people we've ever met they were so hospitable they all they want to do is feed you and make sure you're enjoying the food and have a great time they are so playful they want to take photos and they pose with you and oh the people are just incredible and they make India the amazing country that it is and make the experience amazing so don't worry about safety in terms of being a Solo Traveler or female traveler well then we'll cover that in the other video because we need to dive into it in a deeper way if you are a content creator wanted to make content about India then just be warned about the keyboard Warriors there are a lot of really nasty people on the internet they are brutal in the comments they will be racist towards you and they'll say very nasty things and criticize everything you do but they are not a reflection of the people in India in person at all like it's day and night all right the next section which you've probably been waiting for is the scams there weren't any really really bad scams we can tell you the first of all was Uber drivers asking for cash and asking you to cancel the drive on the app and pay them cash in person that was weird our friend just told us to cancel the drive and book another driver on Uber there are drivers that will charge you a fortune also they'll do meter taxis and the meters will just keep going up and up and up another nap just use Uber the app and try and avoid these guys telling you to cancel and pay in cash it's very important to use the Uber or a authorized taxi service at the airport and not just any random person because some of them take you to a toy or a center and they try to sell you a tour and it's just we've heard very bad stories about people losing a lot of money through that so just try and avoid that all together and then another thing that happened to us in Agra is as we got up the train station a man ushered us to go and get a tuk-tuk he tried to take us into his house to have tea and lunch and stuff but all we really wanted was the tiktok from the train station to our hotel it didn't actually bother us at the time but people told us in the comments that that is a scam and we should never have left with the guy and gone and yeah it was a bit strange rather stick to the proper entry and exit points and you know just stay to the busy areas where it looks like more people are going in and out of the stations and don't be afraid to say no to these people and just go on and get another drive also they are very pushy there guys so you have to be able to just say no no no you have to get used to it and then one that really annoyed us it's not really a scam but it's the guides at The Monuments and stuff well yeah I guess it is a scam so a lot of the guides will especially at the Taj Mahal they also offer to take photos for you and they say no we don't expect anything we're here we're just doing favors but then once they're done taking photos for you they will demand money from you and they will harass you until you pay them the amount that they want so don't actually trust anybody or listen to them that they're doing you a favor because more often than not they're trying to scam you'll get money out of you and literally you can do that with one person you pay one person you walk 10 meters there's another guy trying to do the exact same thing we got hounded at these sites so just just say no no it gets very annoying and you constantly have to say no thank you and then they even have some attitude back and say no no thank you here oh it just it can get kind of ugly sometimes and then finally ATMs some 18 games are dodgy and they will swallow your card and that's the last thing you want to happen in India so try and stick to the air conditioned like multiple ATMs in an air-conditioned room with a security guard outside those are the legitimate ones next is the other section we'll just brush over these quickly it's been quite a long video and there's lots of information one of the things is that you don't throw toilet paper in the toilet you throw it in the bin and use a bum gun it's the best cleanest way to do your business anyway so embrace it in terms of mosquitoes good thing to know is that mosquitoes don't actually carry Dengue and malaria especially if you're going to certain tourist destinations at least in the daily area but do take mosquito repellent anyway to avoid the hundreds of bites that you will encounter then the next and last thing is airport security is literally crazy guys if you have Electronics on you like a camera bag you normally take out just your laptop forget that you're gonna take got absolutely everything I'm talking cables Chargers drone batteries propellers like they'll literally take a whole bag of parts and look at every single item individually it's crazy yeah man a guy even had his big jar of honey taken he had to eat his honey and pour some of it out in terms of drawings I think you should cover that that's important drones I literally did not pack it in my carry-on I stuck it in my checked luggage and they did even find my batteries and my controller and they were like where's the Drone where's the Drone they don't like drones at all and then finally to end this video the question that everybody probably wants to know would we travel back to India the answer is absolutely freaking yes we loved India we love the people and it was just we look back on that month with such fond memories we came out with really cool pictures and stuff we had some ups and downs that's a given I think that's always going to happen in India it is a different place it's crazy and chaotic and loud and not like home at all but just it's amazing embrace it you'll look back on it with very fond memories and you will learn so much about the country and the people and the history and the religion and your highly recommended will definitely be back we even planning a trip and figuring out where we want to go to next time we're in India and that's literally basically everything you need to know about India we hope you guys found this informative there's a lot of stuff it's jam-packed sure leave any other comments if there's anything else you'd like to know and maybe we can answer you in the comments and also if you have other knowledge for fellow Travelers leave it in the comments below too we were first-timers to India we're just sharing what our experience was and what we learned we've also done a similar video for barley you can check it linked above if you're planning a trip there and once again the India resource pack is available for you to download from our website so check it out if you're interested we'll see you guys in the next video bye-bye bye happy travels and time in India thank you [Music]

What could be better?', 'As an Indian🇮🇳  i wanna say there is not only north india for knowing the ancient India 🇮🇳 but there is also many place in south india like Tamil Nadu, kerala, west bengal , assam in west india <br> Because in our india there is different cultures, different people, different histories<br>Having different taste of food in different places 😊🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳', 'As an Indian, sometimes even we also got scammed in places like that😂.<br>But you guys made it like a pro...<br>One thing i may suggest that whatever city you&#39;re visiting just take help from a local friend maybe through Instagram or other local YouTubers. They would be more than happy...', 'Other places to visit as an Indian (apart from delhi and agra) <br>Forts and palaces: jaipur, jodhpur, udaipur, jaisalmer (basically the whole of Rajasthan) <br>Mountains : you can visit ladakh Or go to kashmir (which is one of the most beautiful place ever) or you can go to north-east india. Missouri, shimla, darjeeling, places in Himachal and uttarakhand are some of the most beautiful hill stations. <br>Best scenic beauty : entire india but def go to Kerala and the islands(lakshwadeep and andaman which are often compared to maldives) <br>For colonial architecture and food : Kolkata is the best place.

Infact, the whole south India is beautiful. Also you must try North East part.

Much love guys, love your content and energy ❤️', 'GUJARAT, GOA, MUMBAI AND KERALA on the western coast would be a great trip in my opinion.

Jmg-NIHHDCA;b'Denver Weekend Travel Guide | Plan a Trip to Denver, Colorado';b'Dave Chung';if you're thinking about visiting Denver I'm going to help you have an awesome time while you're here by letting you know where to go and where to eat in one video I live here but we visited Denver about 10 years ago and we loved it so much that we ended up moving our whole family here many moons ago anyone who lives here will tell you that Denver has changed a ton in the past decade so the things that I'm going to suggest in this video are the things that I would do if I was a tourist in my own City right now because especially weather and the time of the year create some variables here I'll give you some options roughly by category so that you can figure out what makes the most sense for you and you can kind of Choose Your Own Adventure make sure to keep watching because I'll also share some things that I think that you can skip on your trip to Denver it could save you a lot of time disappointment and help you make sure that your trip is awesome you've got a trip to plan so let's do this [Music] foreign if you're into art at all or you just have to do something inside because of weather I would check out the Denver Art Museum for the more traditional side meow wolf or something more out there or the Denver Center for Performing Arts also known as a dcpa of course there's a great collection of art inside but the Denver Art Museum is actually a really cool looking building from the outside and it has this giant dustpan that people like to take pictures with when they come to visit if the weather's nice you can walk through Civic Center Park and also take some pictures at the state capitol it's a great way to just knock out a few things without taking multiple trips and now meow wolf it's meow wolf it's really difficult to describe I've been to the location in New Mexico and of course I've been to the one in Denver it is as weird as you would expect if you've looked this up online at all I think ours is a little less crazy than the New Mexico location but I could be desensitized at this point too when people ask if you had fun or what you thought of meow wolf you kind of just nod because your brain is confused at the experience that it just had I do think that most people enjoy this place as long as you're not weirded out by unusual things if you're into a different kind of art I would highly recommend checking out the calendar for the Denver Center for Performing Arts it's one of my favorite places in the city it's about as cool as any Performing Arts venue that you'll find anywhere in the United States and there's always a wide variety of shows playing there as well while you're here I would recommend going to a food hall because they're a big part of our food scene here more specifically I would recommend going to Avanti or the source if you want something quicker not like a full sit-down meal Avanti will make you feel like you live here it has great energy it's fun inside in general this is kind of where Taurus and locals rub shoulders next to each other without knowing it to enjoy some pretty good reasonably affordable quick serve food with No Reservations in terms of food halls it's actually our most successful restaurant incubator a lot of the Stalls in Avanti end up graduating to create their own brick and mortar locations throughout the city it has a big patio with great views of the city and if you're meeting up with friends in Denver everyone knows where Avanti is so it's a pretty easy spot to meet up if you'd rather have a sit-down Food Hall experience the source is Denver's first food Hall and there are a lot of really good options inside while Avanti is more of a cool modern food court with many different Quick Serve options the source is more like a collection of sit-down restaurants that are all in one place and many are surprisingly good anyone who watches my channel knows that I love Tamaki Den it is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city and it's inside the source you can get a surprisingly affordable lunch there without paying a ton of money and it's one of the better sushi places in the city Safta is also inside the source and it's absolutely one of the best restaurants in Denver just make sure to make a reservation if you're planning to go there okay and if you want to go to a food Hall where the food isn't great but the pictures will look amazing you could also go to Milk Market it's by far our most instagram-worthy food Hall I will learn that the food at milk Market is overpriced and not very good but milk Market is also connected to my favorite restaurant in the city Bruto if you can get a reservation there it's a chef's table set up I guarantee you will love it next if the weather allows I would definitely check out a park that's a big part of living here during the day I would check out city park or Wash Park and at night I would consider Cheeseman park for a very interesting reason just in case you're traveling with kids and it's like the spring or the summertime and you're getting nice weather City Park might be the move because it is right next to the Denver Natural History Museum they have a splash pad and also a water area where you can rent paddle boards and things like that it will give you some things to do with your kids that are outside the Denver Zoo is also nearby so this kind of follows that theme of trying to knock out a bunch of things all at once without going back and forth to the same locations but if you don't have kids Wash Park is the place where you will see beautiful people playing volleyball on a sunny day throwing the Frisbee with their dog and just generally having a good time it's in a nice area and it's probably the most popular park in Denver so if I was kidless and traveling I would probably rent a bike and just do a few laps around the park and just take it all in there are also some pretty solid food options right around Wash Park that aren't crazy expensive you could check out nituyo to get molcajete which is super popular right now we also have homegrown tap and dough solid pizza spot very kid-friendly and perdita has fancy Mexican food which I think is pretty good there was a period of my life where I was really into ghost things and that's why we're talking about Cheeseman Park it's built on top of a cemetery and it is home to some paranormal activity that inspired the movie The Changeling and there are some popular ghost tours that you can do here if you end up doing one of these ghost tours I can't guarantee that you'll see anything but you will learn a bunch of random facts about the area and about Denver and maybe you'll take home a ghost as a souvenir maybe of course course if you're a sports person you could check out a nuggets Rockies Broncos or Avalanche game or going to an event or a concert at Red Rocks also a good idea in general Denver is a good sports city with friendly fans that aren't there to start trouble if you're not an aggro fan and you want to come here to see your team you should be okay if you're a music person you could absolutely go out to Red Rocks but do remember that it's about 40 minutes outside of the city I do think that Red Rocks is absolutely one of the top concert venues in the United States but I think that if you're going to drive all the way out there from Denver you need to go for an event whether that's yoga on the Rocks watching a movie or going to a concert it just makes it more worth your time and if you go to a game in the city I would highly recommend pairing it with something nearby so for example if you go to a Rockies game you can check out McGregor Square which is our kind of smaller version of LA Live that's right next to the stadium if you're going to a nuggets or Avalanche game at ball Arena you could check out out Larimer Square which is not far away there are a bunch of great restaurants over there including Rioja and also Tamayo has an all you can eat brunch if you're going to a day game it's a really nice area to walk around especially if the weather's nice if you're not a sports person at all that's totally fine you could pair something like the Denver Botanic Gardens with shells and sauce one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city if you've done some Googling you've probably seen the Rhino Art District pop up when you're looking for things to check out in Denver if I was visiting and I was checking out all this local street art I would also pair it with a really great meal at Uchi Denver Redeemer Pizza cart driver or super mega BN for something a little different the Art District alone is great for pictures and putting things up on the gram but to get the most out of your time in Rhino you might as well get some good food while you're there some people will tell you that when you visit Denver you should go to the Buckhorn Exchange because it is the oldest restaurant in Denver and it also serves game meat personally I would rather do a more modern take on everyday places that people go in Denver to get a better feel for the food scene here you can check out blue pan for pizza the post for fried chicken linger L5 or root down for some very popular sit-down meals L5 has one of the best views from any restaurant in the city so make reservations in advance if you want to take advantage of that and now for some things that I don't think you really need to do in Denver that a lot of people might suggest I don't really think that you have to go to the 16th Street Mall as a destination if you're staying anywhere near downtown chances are you're going to pass by it but I wouldn't carve out a ton of time to hang out here I also don't really think that you need to go to the Cherry Creek Shopping Center area or the Cherry Creek Mall because if you've been to a mall or a nice shopping street before it's kind of the same this might be a little controversial but I don't think that you need to go to the Cherry Cricket to have a burger this makes me sad because this was the first restaurant in Denver that I ever went to it absolutely used to be one of the best burgers in the city many years ago but it's kind of lost some of that recently some people would say the same thing for the Denver Biscuit Company which has one of the longest weights for any brunch in Denver but I think that that kind of has its own appeal the reality is that there are just better Burger options in the city now including Lucy's Burger Bar 5280 Burger Bar and Park Burger if you're looking for incredible Asian food or dim sum I'm sad to say that Denver is just not the spot for that we are getting better I will absolutely say that but you've had better Asian food in other cities also a lot of our best Asian food in the city is in the north suburbs and also in Aurora so if you're planning to stay really in Denver this might take you a little bit out of your way and mess up your Logistics a little bit I talked a little bit about food halls earlier and many people will tell you to go to Denver Central Market and it's completely a legit suggestion it's very nice inside it's cool great place to grab a drink with a friend but the food options are pretty limited so if you're looking for food it's not my Top Choice you also might see Zeppelin station when you're Googling food places to check out in Denver it has really fallen off in the past few years this used to be a food Hall with cool pop-ups from New York City the food has just gotten not good since covet for some reason a lot of people suggest going to Stanley Marketplace which is out in Aurora and it's cool but I don't think that this is a must-see thing to do in Denver it's totally great if you happen to be staying nearby but I feel the same way about it that I feel about Edgewater public market also a cool place looks cool from the outside a lot of food options inside but if you're not staying out that way I don't think that these are must-see things to do there are also a couple things that you're likely to see while you're just organically going around the city including the big bear at the Colorado Convention Center and Sculpture Park by the dcpa they're both cool and they're great tourist pictures to have to remind you of your trip to Denver but I wouldn't plan your whole day around it they're both more of like you see it it looks cool you take a picture snap a selfie with it all good I could literally keep going on this video for an hour but I'll just include some links in the description and on the screen so that you can find some more specifics of things to do in Denver I cover a ton of stuff in those videos so check them

packs a whole lot of punch for some things to do and experience it's safe to say that excitement and relaxation can be had on every corner of zanzibar for starters we recommend you go see zanzibar in its former and current glory by trekking through the old town known as stone town stonetown is the ancient part of zanzibar city which is itself capital of angerja island once there you'll get a perfect picture as to how the old swahili trading towns of east africa used to look sound feel taste and smell get to exploring some of the moving historical sites relating to the long abolished slave trade and learn of the country's history in this regard by visiting the house of wonders this is the tallest and largest building in town and was originally a palace facing the town's central square the building is now home to the national museum of history and culture called the house of wonders due to its many futuristic features for the period and region at least it is where the first elevator in all of east africa was constructed and was also the first in terms of its plumbing and electrical fixtures many of which had never been seen before on this side of the continent a solid outing for history bumps you could also visit prison island or changu which is a stunning island with stunning beaches and nearly transparent blue waters a hot spot for snorkeling there you will be able to see the stunning and varied collection of marine life the island has along its shores the island is also home to the ancient giant tortoises as many of them call this island home another must visit would have to be the birthplace of the famed rock star and lead man of the popular band queen the legend mr freddie mercury himself the small museum in the family's former home pays homage to the island's most famous son there you can look at old yellowing family photographs of his early years the first piano he ever played and a selection of stage costumes that were actually worn by the icon himself once the sightseeing has concluded we recommend you take a breather by visiting one of the many rooftop restaurants scattered throughout the city a perfect closer would be some traditional zanzibar tea or coffee and the must visit spot for this in the old town would have to be jaws corner a staple within the city and comes highly recommended by locals and tourists alike stone town is a mixed bag of stunning archaeological wonder historical artifacts and stunning natural beauty other must-see sites include the old fort the slave museum and darajani market for some more time on the beach we recommend you head to the north westernmost tip of the island nungli there you can enjoy a relatively less travelled region but just as beautiful if not a more splendid stretch of white sanded indian ocean kissed pristine beaches there's a doubletree resort by hilton here plus a few lodges decorated by tropical gardens beach cottages and stunning sea view restaurants as we mentioned it is relatively quieter than the rest of the beach spots on the island so get in while the secret is still a secret we suggest that you use the trivalla.com link in the description to book a stay at the doubletree hilton resort as it really does help the channel out if you haven't gotten your fill of tanzania's marine life you stand your best chance at eyeballing some more exotic goodies with a snorkel tour around member island the islands of zanzibar have some of the world's most stunning underwater landscapes and as such is a hotbed for dive and snorkel enthusiasts the member atoll is hands down one of the best spots to do so sticking to beach and water themed activities another must try would have to be kite surfing at pagey beach beginners need not fret there are many schools and rental shops all along the beach willing and able to take you out on the water and show you the ropes other beaches of mention include the eastern duo matemway and pingui and the southeastern duo donggui and jambiani many believe that the beauty of the islands are best exemplified and encapsulated within the boundaries of the shizani forests and they certainly wouldn't be incorrect in saying so true beauty is in the eyes of the beholder but whatever your measuring stick is if this doesn't meet and exceed your expectations then you need a new measuring stick yours is broken it is home to one of the rarest species of primates on the planet the red columbus monkey the park is open every day from 7 30 a.m to 5 p.m there is an entrance fee of eight dollars that includes a brief tour there

eat for as long as we draw breath our foodies shall never be neglected this is a pledge we at designing your travels intend to hold true too so let's get to the munchies shall we as we mentioned at the outset the islands of zanzibar happen to be quite the cultural melting pot this cultural mix has shaped every facet of this island including its cuisine which boasts inspiration from asia the west africa and the oceanic to understand and appreciate the cuisine of the islands book a spice store doing so you will truly be able to grasp why zanzibar is referred to as the spice island most of these spice tours depart from stone town and take you to a large spice farm to see touch and taste the many flavors of zanzibar if you feel empowered to put your newly acquired spices to work why not book a traditional zanzibar cooking class via the link in the description most classes will take you out to the market to collect the ingredients and then show you how to prepare traditional zanzibar food finally let's get to the must try dishes the zanzibar pizza we spoke of earlier is less of a pizza and more of a pancake the dough is folded up so that all the ingredients are inside and then it's cooked on a hot metal pan you can get these with chicken or beef and they usually also include an egg cheese onion bell peppers and mayo or you can go the dessert route and fill it with sweeter filling like nutella or fruit mandazi is another must try it is a fried dough treat similar to a doughnut but not a sweet the asian influence shows itself in the biryani dishes you can find on the island biryani is a traditional indian rice and meat dish that is spice filled and delicious mishkaki is a staple dish that is basically a meat kebab where the meat is marinated in spices and then grilled seeing that you are on an island get experimental and try it with some fresh local octopus odd combination but one that will blow your mind and taste buds we would be remiss if we didn't also mention the rock restaurant on the shores of the beautiful michianwe pingue beach this italian restaurant is built on a rock in the middle of the sea and is a unique experience from beginning to end especially to those who are crazy about the gram be aware though if the tides are down you can simply walk to and from the restaurant however if the tides are up you will need to ask a small boat to

HyL1rO8BTU8;b'SINGAPORE TRAVEL GUIDE: Everything You Need to Know';b'Yellow Productions';"- Everything you need to
know to visit Singapore. The first thing you need to know is just a little bit about this place. In this country there
are 6 million people. It is known for having
skyscrapers, modernity, but also they've done a really great job of keeping green in the city. Singapore is often
nicknamed the Garden City. Now, although there are these skyscrapers, there's also great culture
in the city, temples, and of course, delicious food. Shopaholics are definitely gonna enjoy the shopping on Orchard Road. If you're flying in here, you're gonna love the airport
because Singapore's airport has been named the best
airport in the world. We're gonna talk more about that later. And if English is your
primary language, well, Singapore is a great place to visit because English is one of the
defacto official languages of Singapore. Pack your bags and let's
check out this great country. The second thing to
know is some information to help you get oriented to Singapore and one of the best places to do that, right here in front of the Merlion. This is the unofficial
mascot of Singapore, half lion, half mermaid. And this is where everybody comes to get their selfie of Singapore. But there's a lot to
know about this place, more than just here. So Singapore is a city state, meaning that it's a country
and a city altogether. The country only has one
city, and that is Singapore. It is located at the southern
tip of the Malay Peninsula. There are two bridges
that connect Singapore to the Malaysia mainland. Now back inside the city of Singapore, to the south of Marina Bay, and actually that way is Singapore's
central business district. This is home to high rise
financial corporations in really tall skyscrapers. But really part of the charm of Singapore is how it's blended, the
classic with the historic and right next to the financial district is Chinatown with old school
eateries, old school temples. You'll smell incense as you're
walking the streets of it, and so that juxtaposition
walking around this place, super cool. To the north of the Merlion
is the Singapore River that comes inland from Marina Bay. This area is the colonial
heart of Singapore. It is known as the Civic District. This is where you'll find a
lot of Singapore's museums, also government buildings, and there's a lot of
really neat neighborhoods right along that river. You'll see neighborhoods like
Clarke Quay and Boat Quay, and you'll see them spelled Q U A Y. That's pronounced key. You'll find a lot of Singapore's nightlife around those two quay neighborhoods. The shopping hub of Singapore
lies along Orchard Road, is the central shopping street of the city with over 20 shopping
malls just on one street. More about shopping in
the section of this video dedicated all to shopping. Being a melting pot for numerous cultures, there are also a ton of really
neat ethnic neighborhoods worth visiting, including little India with an elaborate Hindu temple. Kampong Glam, home to the
amazing Sultan Mosque, Geylang Serai, and one of Singapore's oldest Malay settlements. Singapore also has 63 islands, though most visitors only
visit one other island other than the main one,
which is Sentosa Island. Sentosa Island could be
considered the theme park beach resort of Singapore. It's home to tons of fun things to do, including the beaches,
including zip lines, including water parks and including home to Universal Studios Singapore. The third thing to know is
about getting into Singapore. And if you're flying into Singapore, you're gonna be flying into
Changi International Airport, one of the best airports in the world. Nay, the best airport in the world. And now you might be thinking, Chris, if you're talking about airports, why are you standing in
front of a waterfall? This is at the airport. This is at the jewel, the
crown jewel of the airport. Basically a $1.7 billion shopping mall that connects all of the terminals. You don't even need a
ticket to come in here. People who live in Singapore come here because it is just so cool. Changi airport is
incredibly well connected to the rest of the world. Over 100 airlines operate
flights out of here to 400 different cities. It was originally built
out as a transit hub and the idea was let's make
Singapore an amazing place to connect and then people stop over and check out Singapore
while they're here. But now the airport itself has become a destination for many. Like many people come to Singapore just to hang out for like
a day or a day and a half in the airport before going home. And so it's interesting though that unlike most other airports,
there are no separate zones for departing and arriving passengers in the main terminals
prior to passport control. So therefore, if you're
arriving in Singapore's airport, you're free to shop and eat at the air-side establishments on arrival. There are four total
terminals with terminal four specializing mostly on
the budget carriers. Each terminal has really
fantastical things. Terminal one has a swimming pool, terminal two has a music
listening area with couches. Terminal three has a butterfly garden. Connecting this place is the jewel and up on top is the canopy bridge. From 23 meters above,
you've got glass floors and fog machines. I mean I could go on
and on about the jewel. In fact I will, I'll have
a whole separate video if you just wanna watch
a tour of this place. Now because this is a
big connecting airport, the Singapore tourism actually offers like tours of the city. Even if you've only got
as little as four hours, you can do that. But even though so many
people only do Singapore as a stopover, I think it's
worth at least five days, way more than just a stopover. Now if you're flying in here
and you're coming to Singapore, they've moved their
arrivals paperwork online. You need to submit your
Singapore arrival card via their website or the MyICA mobile app. It's free, don't pay
for any shady services. But if you do that, then when
you come in to Singapore, if you're one of the countries that are eligible for the eGates, then you don't even have
to see a passport agent. You can just tap your
passport, take a picture, get your fingerprint taken,
and then you're in Singapore. For me, it was 30 minutes
flat from the time I landed to the time I went through
customs, passport control, baggage claim and I was
in a taxi to the city. 30 minutes from landing to the city. I mean, that never happens anywhere else. Okay, so how do you get to the city? I usually take a taxi. It's about 20 to 40 Singaporean dollars, takes about 30 minutes to the city centre. For me it was $25 to the JW Marriott that I was staying at on this trip. You can also take the MRT, which is their version of a subway. It also runs to the airport. It has a stop in the
basement of terminal two. It's definitely the
cheapest way into the city. It'll cost you around
two Singaporean dollars, but it's not super convenient 'cause you do have to
transfer at least once, probably only good if you
don't have that much luggage. There's also numerous
buses to the airport, from the airport to the city. If you're going to Orchard Road, then bus 36 is your best bet. That's also around $2. Now you don't just have
to fly into Singapore. There's a couple more ways you can get in. If you're coming from Malaysia, you can come across
those two bridges by land that I told you about earlier. Or you can also come in here by ferry. There are five ferry terminals
that handle ferry traffic from neighboring Malaysian
and Indonesian cities. And there's a major cruise
port over at harbor front. The four thing to know is
about getting around Singapore. And the best way to
get around Singapore is to use that thing that I told you not to take from the airport, the MRT or the mass rapid transit. Sometimes you'll see it as the SMRT, the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit, and they got a section called the LRT, the light rapid transit or
light rail rapid transit. Anyway, that's enough acronyms. You should know that the MRT, the subway, the train in Singapore, it's amazing, it's clean, it's fast,
efficient, and it's cheap. For the cheapest rides, get
yourself an ezlink card. That's the stored value card,
you can tap in and tap off. In a pinch, you can use your
Visa or MasterCard with tap, but you'll pay 50 cents extra
per ride if you're doing that. when you're not taking the MRT, the second best way to
get around is by walking. Singapore is a very walkable
place, although hot, which makes it a little harder to walk. What is nice is there are
a ton of covered walkways, great to keep you outta the sun, great to keep you out of the rain. Do bring an umbrella with you when you're around Singapore though because the covered
walkways aren't everywhere and the rain can come down
really quick without any notice. And so it's really useful
to have an umbrella when you're walking around. You'll find taxis to be
plentiful, metered and honest within the city though
they often can't stop on the side of the road to pick you up 'cause it's illegal to
do that in many places. You'll need to go to a
taxi stop or taxi rank or a hotel that has a taxi
to reliably pick up a taxi, or you can use the Grab app. Grab is the ride share app in Singapore. It's not Uber, it's not Lyft, it's Grab. So maybe download that to
your phone before you go. One more thing you should
know about taxis is there's not really a standard
color for taxis in Singapore. They come in all different
colors but there are larger taxis which will charge more on the meter. And then on the sign up here it says there are limousine taxis which are like the white or black taxis and they actually don't have
to charge you by the meter. I took one of those back from the zoo 'cause it was a rainy
day and it was $25 for me to get to the zoo in a regular taxi and it was $50 for me
to get back from the zoo in a limousine taxi. But let me tell you, the
limousine taxi was awesome. Why, in a pinch, because when it's raining and it was raining when I was at the zoo, there were no taxis and I used Grab and there were no cars available as well. So in that case, use limousine taxi instead of just being stuck in purgatory. Oh and of course there's the bus. Singapore has a ton of bus routes. They're clean, they're efficient. They do get caught up
in traffic a little bit, but if you're like taking
a route say out to the zoo or someplace where maybe
the MRT doesn't run, you'll end up taking a bus. Some are single decker,
some are double decker. You'll find all the stops in English. I think it's pretty easy to navigate. Google Maps will do a pretty good job of telling you the bus routes to go on if you can't get there on the MRT. Bicycling, not really a thing
for transportation here. I mean there are people
who ride bikes in Singapore but there aren't really
a lot of bike lanes or a lot of bike paths. It's illegal to ride
bikes on the sidewalk. You have to ride them on the street. I don't know, I think the other public transportation options are so good and it rains so often that I wouldn't recommend riding a bike. Another neat way to get around is by boat. You can take a bumboat
along the Singapore River, more of a sightseeing cruise, but that's a neat way to see the city. Should you rent a car? Look, I don't think so. I mean the place is so small and the public transportation is so good and the rental cars are so expensive. Just leave the rental car at the airport. The fifth thing to know is about
the weather and when to go. Singapore is officially classified as a tropical rainforest climate. What does that mean? It means that it's hot
and humid all year long. There are really no distinct seasons when it comes to the
temperature all year round. The average high temperature
is 88 degrees Fahrenheit and the average nighttime temperature, the average low, is 78 degrees Fahrenheit. Hot and humid and in the
midday sun on a sunny day, really quite oppressive and miserable. The seasons are rainy and dry
or maybe rainy and less rainy. January to March is
considered the dry season with like a 25% chance of
real rain any given day. And then the wet season
is the rest of the year with the height of that
being in like October with a 60% chance of rain
any given day in October. But I find, like that's
like significant rain. It rains almost every
day here in Singapore so do make sure you carry
that umbrella with you that I was talking about before. Today, I really got rained on quite a bit and it was like the one day I looked at the weather forecast on Google, which is worthless, don't do that. Like you need to look at like
a Singaporean weather forecast to really find out if it's gonna rain. But you know what? Gray days like this actually
probably are your best friend because these are the days
when it's gonna keep it a bit on the cooler side so you're just not like
completely baked under the sun. Now I say all of this like the weather is just so hot that you shouldn't come and look, nothing's
further from the truth. It's hot here, but the great part is that like all the buildings are like
super well air conditioned, well besides the Hawker centres, but they love to air
condition their buildings down to like 60 degrees Fahrenheit. So that like when you go into
a hotel or a shopping mall, you're like, oh, I can finally,
I can finally cool down. You might wanna bring a light
jacket if you're not used to really cold air conditioning 'cause you'll find the inside
here to be really cold. Good for me as a Californian, but Europeans tell me the
inside AC is too cold for them. Now speaking of flash storms,
here's one of those now. Two hours ago, perfectly sunny. Right now, thunder, lightning. The typical pattern in Singapore as the government weather service shows and also as the taxi driver told me today on the drive out here,
is it's typically clear in the morning and the
thunderstorms in the afternoon. And so if you're planning
outdoor activities, do them in the morning. That's your highest likelihood
of having things dry. And then plan your indoor
or covered activities for the afternoon. Luckily I'm undercover
here at the River Park at the Singapore zoo. These covers are nice but
the thunder and lightning is quite, quite loud. Let's talk about money. The currency in Singapore
is the Singaporean dollar. Credit cards are pretty widely accepted across Singapore. Visa or MasterCard are the primary ones. I would say about 90% of the places you're gonna spend your money, they're gonna take credit cards. The places that won't are maybe some of the Hawker centre stalls stalls and also some
of the street vendors. So it is worthwhile for you
to have some cash on hand. I guess in a pinch you
could go to Maxi-Cash and pawn some of your stuff. That looks like it's
like a upscale pawn shop. But where do you get your money? I like to get my money out
of ATMs at the airport, is where I like to get it from. If you wanna prefer to get
it from a money changer, there's money changers at the airport. There's money changers
throughout the city. I am told some of the best rates are at the money changers in little India. I haven't used them but I've heard a lot of people tell me that if you're looking to like exchange a lot of money and really want a good
rate, then that's an option. Now related to a lot of money, Singapore really is kind
of an expensive destination as far as Southeast Asia is concerned. Now compared to like Thailand or Malaysia, things in Singapore are probably gonna be two to three times as much. The meals at Hawker
centres are pretty cheap. But if you're going to a
fancy sit down restaurant, you can expect to pay a
couple hundred dollars. The luxury hotels in this city, we're gonna talk more about
those later in hotels, but you can expect to pay, you know, 300 Singaporean dollars a night or more. If you want cheap then you
know, visit some of the- Like Malaysia, you can get
there in like 30 minutes from Singapore and you can eat over there. Indonesia is also just a ferry ride away. So you can do cheap after
your Singaporean vacation, but do plan to budget a bit more than the rest of Southeast Asia. Although I think Singapore
does get a bum wrap when it comes to cost that it's actually, it doesn't have to be
expensive, it can be. There was the movie Crazy
Rich Asians that talks about how expensive Singapore is. But I think today, I've spent all of like, since I got up this
morning and it's 6:00 PM, I think I've spent all
of 25 Singaporean dollars to eat breakfast, lunch,
second lunch and dessert. The second thing to know is about food and really one of the reasons why I come to Singapore and many people
come to Singapore is to eat. The food is amazing and
it can be had for cheap. So let me tell you where you're gonna get some of the city's most
delicious and cheap food. It is at Hawker centres. I am sitting in a Hawker centre right now. The Singapore government created these to like clean up the city's act to take out the street vendors
that were out in the street, put them in a central place where they could have running water, electricity, good hygiene. Now there are over a hundred
of these Hawker centres in Singapore and you can
get like a plate of noodles for you know, three Singaporean dollars at one of these places. They are tasty, they are
great, they are busy. This is like Singapore's
central dining room when it comes to lunchtime. And so if you come to one of these, you can't find a place to sit, it's totally cool to like
join somebody to sit with them 'cause they are quite popular. I've got a whole guide
about Hawker centres that'll be coming out soon. But if you wanna know some of the three main touristy hawker centres, number one is Newton Circus. This is the one that was
featured in Crazy Rich Asians. It is the closest to Orchard
Road if you're staying there. I actually don't love this Hawker centre and I wouldn't recommend that you like go there
for the tastiest food, go there 'cause you saw it in the movie. Go there to take great selfies. But what I don't like about
Newton Circus is they tout. What does it mean to tout? Meaning that there's constantly people walking around hassling you
to like order their food. So I don't love that. It's not a peaceful eating experience. The one I do like that's
in the centre of the city is Lau Pa Sat. It's in the central business district. There's a hundred stalls in there. They're pretty good and in the evenings, they have saute street where
they cook meat on a stick over charcoal outside. So definitely do check out
Saute street at Lau Pa Sat. And then number three
is Gluttons by the Bay. This is right on Marina Bay. It's best at nighttime 'cause you can sit out there, open air, have some classic Singaporean chili crab while you enjoy the view
of Marina Bay Sands. But with over a hundred of these, don't just limit yourself to those. If you're wandering around
the city and you're hungry, it's lunchtime and you
see one, stop and eat, that's what I did today. This is the Albert Centre
at the Bugis street market. I didn't plan to eat here but I was hungry and I was over at the Bugis Street market and I'm like, oh look,
there's a Hawker centre. Why don't I go and get some noodles? You should do the same. Oh, and if you don't know what to eat, well you know, a good
tip is always to find one with the longest line. Okay, maybe not the longest line 'cause the lines can
be like seriously long in these Hawker centres. You know, maybe find one that
has like a medium length line. Now if you want something a
little bit more air conditioned, Singapore has a lot of food courts that are kind of like Hawker centres except in a shopping mall with AC. Some of my favorites are the
Food Republic chain of them. Right now, I'm in the
Food Republic in VivoCity. This is a great place if you're connecting with Sentosa Island 'cause the cable car and the Sentosa Island Express train basically both come right from here. What do I have? I've got the mango shave ice with fresh mango and mango ice cream. Mmm. $3.50, so what, a dollar more than the shave ice at like
the Chinatown complex. So yeah, you do pay a little bit more for the AC but I think it's well worth it. Some of my other favorite Food Republics in Suntec City by the Esplanade MRT. Also in Ion Orchard, down in
the basement on Orchard Road. I really have the food court in there. I think that's on like basement level. Oh, and sometimes people
say I spend too much time in these videos talking about food. Like Chris, is it a travel guide
or is it just a food video? And so if you wanna see more about my favorite Hawker
centre recommendations or what particular dishes I recommend, I've broken that out
into a separate video. You can find the link to
that in the description or at the end of this video
in my Singapore playlist as soon as it's done. Oh and bonus, because this
food court is air conditioned, I actually still have ice in here, unlike the ones I ate
at the Hawker centres that by the time I was
done recording my video, I was just eating cold sugar water. The eight thing to know is about shopping and if eating is the first
national pastime in Singapore, then shopping is the second
national pastime in Singapore. You know, shopping malls are dying around a lot of the world, particularly in the USA
but not in Singapore. Shopping malls are alive and well. Why? Because shopping
malls here are amazing. Hundreds of stores, all of
them have different designs. You know, it's not just the same Westfield cookie cutter mall placed in every city around the country. Well, there's only one
city around the country and so they really have
to compete quite a bit. There's so many international
tourists that visit here. A lot of people come here to
spend their money and shop. Most of their major stores and the malls stay open until either
8:00 PM or 10:00 PM, though some stores are
getting into a monthly stay open till midnight routine. If you want to know about
the best shopping malls in Singapore, I've got a
whole video coming up on that. But if you want to do some
outdoor street market shopping, well, there's not that many of them because it rains a lot in Singapore so almost everything is covered inside. The two, three that you'll find outside, I got a video all about those. The bugis market, the Chinatown market, and then there's like a little
pavilion in little India for those traditional
outdoor shopping experiences. Let's talk about the hotels in Singapore. And there's quite the range
of accommodation choices for you here from hostels
and capsule hotels that are like $25 a night to
the lavish marina-based sands that'll cost you upwards of $600 a night. My typical go-tos are
the Conrad Centennial, the Marriott Tang Plaza on Orchard Road, and on this trip I stayed at
the JW Marriott South Beach. That is my new favorite Singapore hotel if you can swing the cost. It was $600 a night during this trip, though I used Marriott points and if you get it for 300
then I think it's a steal. I really like to stay in the city centre, either right like around Marina
Bay or along Orchard Road. Those would be the places
I would recommend to you 'cause they're closest to
all the tourist attractions. You can walk to things, you can walk, if you're staying around Marina Bay, you can walk to take
pictures with the merlion, you can walk to eat and you can come back in the middle of the
day to like take a nap or change your clothes
or take another shower because it gets so hot here. You should know about the
language they use in Singapore. And there's four official
languages in Singapore, English, Mandarin,
Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. Now you'll find a lot of things in a lot of different languages. This green tea can says it all. It's in like four different languages. You'll hear a lot of languages spoken. But if all you speak is English, you'll be able to get around just fine because English is the defacto language. It's the language used in government, it's the language used on most signs. Although you will see
signs in other languages, they don't have to just be in English. But the interesting thing
about the English spoken here is it has really a very
interesting pronunciation and a whole set of words
that are basically added in from the other languages
that people speak here. They call the English spoken here Singlish or Singaporean English and
it's based on British English and then they add Cantonese words in. And the most common one is lah. And when I was at the zoo,
I'm at the zoo right now. So when I was at the zoo I heard, you know, a mom telling her daughter that all of the elephants
there are female. And the daughter says like, really, why? And the mom's like, I don't know. And then the daughter says,
well can you use Google lah? Like you just add lah at
the end of every word. It'll take you a little while probably to get used to the Singaporean English and at first you might
think people aren't speaking to you in English. It's much faster than normal
English and like I say, has those Chinese words tossed in. You know you can study up on
a few of those Singlish words. And you know they love it here so much that they've even got it on
like a plate in a gift shop, they're so proud of their Singlish. The 11 thing to know is about the laws, and Singapore is famous around the world for having some very strict laws. Let me just tell you about a few that you should know as a visitor. Number one, vandalism
is punishable by caning. So graffiti tagging, etching your name to the bathroom wall, just don't do it. Overstaying your visa
also punishable by caning. So however long you have
to stay in Singapore, leave when it's your turn to leave. They're also really strict
on drug trafficking. Drug trafficking in Singapore,
punishable by death. And that includes whether you're bringing actual drugs into the country or whether there are just
drugs in your system. So you know, even though
marijuana may be legal in certain states in the USA or Amsterdam, you probably wanna wait a little while before you do that and
you come to Singapore because if it's in your system, it's considered drug trafficking. And now one of the ones
that's often misunderstood is chewing gum. Chewing gum itself is
not illegal in Singapore. Like you'll have a really
hard time buying it here. You can bring it with you, just make sure you don't spit it out on the ground. Littering, spitting, also against the law. And finally the one that's kind of funny but you should be aware of too, is they have this like
love-hate relationship with the durian. It's this like spiny, stinky
fruit and it is not allowed in many places in Singapore,
including on Singapore's MRT. So don't buy a durian and expect to take public transit back to your hotel. I guess you're gonna probably
just like buy your durian and then eat it where you bought it, so you keep the durian stink to yourself. Number 13, you should know
about the electrical power here in Singapore. They use British style type G outlets which have three kind of
square-ish prongs at 230 volts. If you're coming from the USA,
you're gonna need an adapter from the plug size and you
should check the voltage of your electrical items to make sure they operate on 230 volts. The like fancy hotels, JW
Marriott I'm staying in, they've got plugs that'll like work for US style plugs and
the British style plugs, but they won't adapt the voltage. If you are at one of those hotels, sometimes the front desk will actually have a voltage converter if you have electrical devices that don't switch between the two. 13 thing to know is about casinos. And if you wanna gamble in
Singapore, there are two casinos. There is this one at Resorts
World on Sentosa Island and the second one is
at the Marina Bay Sands in that futuristic
surfboard looking building. Now if you're a foreigner, you can get into these casinos for free, but you have to show your passport and your like immigration email that you get from coming into the country. Why do you have to do that? Well, to discourage locals from gambling, they charge Singaporean
residents $150 a day to come to the casinos or $3,000
a year for an annual pass. So lucky you, you can come in for free just by showing your passport. Make sure you have your
phone and you can pull up that email that has the barcode
with your immigration card 'cause that's how they
do the immigration cards. You need to show both
those every time you go in and every time you exit the casinos. They're not gonna feel like Vegas casinos. They're not like lively and boisterous. They're pretty sedate and quiet, you know, because when people come here, particularly the locals and
they've spent their $150, you know it's for an
intense gambling session where they're really focused on winning. You will find some pretty
good cheap eats inside though. All right, now I'll talk about
everybody's favorite subject that I know you've been
waiting for, toilets. Insert poop emoji here. In Singapore in general,
toilets are clean, plentiful and modern, in general. There are some that are not. You will occasionally
see the squatty potty, which is the Asian style squat toilet. If you find one of those,
just find another stall. Generally there will just be one of those and there'll be the
standard western toilets for everybody else. Also, if you are in a toilet
where there's toilet paper as you walk in the door, take it with you because that means there
won't be any toilet paper when you actually get in the stall. And then many of the restrooms that you'll find in
Hawker centres or in MRTs, like in the subway, typically
don't have paper towels or any towels of any form so
if you wanna dry your hands, make sure you've got some
towels with you, yourself. Oh, and most of the toilets are free though every once in a
while you'll find a toilet that costs a few cents. If you're walking around the city and can't figure out where to go, shopping malls are always a good bet and so are the fancy five star hotels. Just walk in like you own the place and you're staying there. They'll assume you are staying there, too. Okay, let's talk about some
of the best things to do while you're in Singapore. And if you're here for a few days, my number one recommendation
is to visit the Singapore Zoo. I say a few days because
it's a little bit of a haul to get here, and so allocate a full day or at least a full half
day to visit the zoo. If you love animals or even
if you kind of love animals, this is the world's best zoo. It's amazing. I got a whole video just on this place. You can check that out in the description or at the end of this video when it's out. Now, if you're less of a nature lover and more of a theme park lover, then you should definitely
visit Sentosa Island. This is basically Singapore's playground. It's home to Universal Studio Singapore. It's home to a huge aquarium. It's home to a huge water park. The best way to get into Sentosa Island is to take the cable car. There's a really neat cable car that'll bring you in here
from the top of Mount Faber with amazing views. You can also take the monorail from the VivoCity Shopping mall. Or just take a taxi,
which is what I did today. It's about $15 from the centre
of the city to get here. Also, if you're into gambling, you will find a casino
here inside Resorts World. There's a second casino over
at the Marina Bay Sands, but we'll talk about that when we talk about the Marina Bay Sands because that's definitely
on the things to-do list. Now, if you like to be out
in nature, go for a hike. Singapore has a lot of great hiking paths. These are the hiking paths
here on Sentosa Island. Many of the most popular
hiking paths are paved because it rains here so
much that if it wasn't, they would get muddy. But one of my favorite hikes is the Singapore Southern Ridges hike. I've got a whole video just on this one, but what's cool about this,
it starts up at Mount Faber where the cable car
comes into Sentosa Island and then you take it along these ridges and you can see the city and
you can stop if you want to. It's a good half day hike and it's just, it's a really neat vantage point of Singapore. Or you can get out more into the jungle and go hang out and see
the wildlife out there. There's wild monkeys,
there's wild lizards, surprising for such a
highly developed place, but they've really developed
certain parts of it and then kept other parts
of it to be quite natural. Though, if you're gonna go out into the jungle, you know,
bring some mosquito repellent because mosquitoes can be fierce here. So you do wanna make it out to the beach here at Sentosa Island. You can just take the train
all the way to the end and you'll be right here at Siloso Beach. These are manmade beaches,
pretty white sand, pretty peaceful here. What's less peaceful or like kind of weird is Singapore is like a huge
maritime shipping place. And so looking right off in this distance of this very peaceful beach are tons of cargo ships just waiting
to unload their cargo. There's also a neat musical
fountain that you can see here, and it has a nighttime show on the weekends and holidays, too. I ran into fellow explorers,
Kai and sons here in Singapore, all the way from Australia and Kai, what one thing do you have to share with your fellow
explorers about Singapore? - We love coming here, it's
our family destination. We love the nightlife,
we like the temperature. It is quite hot. - We love the roller coasters. - We like the roller
coasters and we love Sentosa, that's for sure. We definitely love Sentosa
Island and Universal Studios and the shopping. The shopping's great fun, too. The boys like going and checking
out all the latest in gear that Singapore has to offer. So yeah, we have a good time here. It's definitely a family
destination for sure. - Sad this is our last day.
- It's our last day. - [Host] How long have you spent here? - Seven days. - [Host] Seven days?
- Seven days. It was seven days in the US prior to here. So yeah, it was absolutely awesome. - Visit Kampong Glam, the ethnic hub for the Malay people
and the Muslim community in Singapore because it's home to the 200 year old Sultan Mosque. When I was here, they were
celebrating the holy month of Ramadan, so they had like
a street festival set up. So if you're here during
Ramadan, you might be able to partake in some great
Muslim feast out in front. Or if not, you can go in between 10 to 12 or two to four every day. If you wanna go check out the mosque, you do have to take off your shoes. And if you have bare shoulders or if you have shorts like I do, then they'll give you
some appropriate clothing to wear while you're inside. Now there are a lot of
neat nooks and crannies in this neighborhood and if you get off the main Sultan street
there with the mosque, another cool alley to check
out is called Haji Lane. And even the streets around it, they've got like covers to walk under, but this is Haji Lane right here. It's this narrow little alley
with restaurants, cafes, street art, just a super cool vibe. If you're a history buff
then you'll definitely enjoy a visit to the National
Museum of Singapore in this really cool looking
building from the 1800s. This museum goes over how
Singapore got its start and became the nation it is today, bringing all these
different cultures together into this melting pot, coming
out of British colonial rule, becoming a part of Malaysia, ultimately becoming an independent nation and more is what you'll learn in that really pretty neat museum, worth a couple hours of your time. And now a great way to explore nature, even on a rainy or hot day, is to come visit Gardens by the Bay. Gardens by the Bay, it's a huge parcel that's really like a modern garden. And in this modern garden, it's free to just stroll the gardens, but they've got a couple
of paid attractions. They've got this super grove of trees that does a nighttime show. That's free, but you can
go on a bridge across it for amazing views. Costs you money to go up there. The main attraction
though are the two domes. There's a flower dome, which
by the name, has flowers in it. When I was here, they had
cherry blossoms in there. They've got seasonal flowers like tulips, those sorts of things. The main dome is this one
that I'm in right now, the cloud forest dome that is this, like it's a rainforest in a dome. And every two hours, it mists. And so you want to be
here on the even hours when the mist starts to come
up because it's really cool. It's like, if you wanna
do both domes, it's $53. And yes, it's kind of expensive,
but I think it's worth it. If you want a free garden, you can visit the Royal Botanic Gardens. That's a more traditional garden-garden. Free admission there except
to go in the orchid garden. That's gonna cost you money. And you should also visit
the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Why do I mention that
while I'm standing here in Gardens by the Bay? Well, because it's right out there. They are like right next to each other. Marina Bay Sands, that's the second casino
here in Singapore. It's got a great shopping mall, it's got a great food
court in the basement and there's a nighttime light show that you can watch out on the
bay, couple times nightly. That is free admission. Well, fellow explorers, I
hope you enjoyed this video. If you did, please give it a thumbs up and if you wanna see more

I just wanted to add that with so many Muslim Malays living on the island, there are many delicious Halal restaurants. I remember having BBQ baby octopus at a Halal restaurant. It was very tasty!<br>Another favorite type of destination of mine is all the Christian churches. Many of them were built over 100 years ago. One such favorite is Chijmes, which used to be a Catholic convent. Now it&#39;s a food center with many delicious restaurants. The wedding scene from &quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot; was filmed in the chapel there.<br>For those wanting cheap shopping, you can take a 60 minute ferry ride from Harbourfront to Batam Island, Indonesia. Many Singaporeans shop there.<br>Lastly, since it&#39;s a former British colony, don&#39;t forget to look both ways when you cross the street since they drive on the left side of the road there.', 'Been following your travel vlogs for years and in 2019 I planned my 10 day Singaporean holiday based on the wonderful accurate info you gave in your Singapore series videos. My mum and I had the best holiday ❤ We just love Singapore &amp; feel we saw &amp; travelled Singapore quite extensively, thanks to all your travel tips 👌🙌⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️❤', 'Hello, Sir.

VbVtNxZPGWc;"b""Under Armour Shorts Review // Under Armour Men's Tech Graphic Shorts""";b'Digital David';hey everyone Digital David here today in this video I'm gonna be unboxing and reviewing the Under Armour Men's Tech graphic shorts I did purchase these shorts myself and any opinion expressed in this video is strictly my own that being said if you're interested in this product you want to find out more about us a link to it will be in my video description below go ahead and check it out there they have multiple colors and sizes available for you I got the size small I have another pair of Under Armour shorts that I just bought recently and I got them in a men's size small and they fit perfectly I have a size 30 waist I Teeter on 29 and 34 my waist size so excited to see if these are true to fit as well now let's go ahead let's open them up and look at the package contents here oh the package contents we just have the shorts and a tag for them you can see on the tag it says heat here keeping you cool so obviously these shorts are designed with the fabric in mind to be quick drying and very comfortable and ultra soft so they do feel really soft can't wait to try them on this is the back side of the shorts right here you can see the Under Armour logo that we have it's kind of got a rubbery grippy feel to it just on the logo portion you can see one of our pockets right here on the front side of the shorts so let's go ahead let's flip them over so now you can see the front side so you can see here's the shorts pockets one on each side if I can kind of lay that out maybe a little bit better well anyways there they are you can kind of see them right there and then I can pull the pockets out too so we just have like a mesh lining on the inside you can see we do have a drawstring as well too for easy adjustment and comfort and then we can open this up too you can see our sizing right there and they're loose-fitting Heat here again we have another tag as well right there for you you could rip that out if you want and we even have a QR code you could scan to so in case you're wondering these shorts are 84 percent polyester and 16 percent elastane so I'm assuming that 16 percent elastic right there check them out they look really cool love the logo on the side I got them in black graphite but again they have a ton of different options inversions online so be sure to use that link below now let me go ahead let's try them on and see how they fit now we got the pants cam right here you can see how they fit I got my hands in my pockets they're really nice shorts I'm already really happy and excited that I picked these ones out and bought them for myself they just look great guys really happy with them the fit and feel really nice guys pockets are plenty deep too I got a phone we can go ahead we can throw that in there that's the Google pixel 3a maybe you can see it right there in my pocket plenty of room for an even larger device multiple devices that sort of thing right there so very very comfortable don't forget we can adjust the waist right here to pull it tight and tie it up if we want a secure fit but they're definitely loose-fitting not too tight very very breathable flexible if you want to workout running these do anything along those lines you'll be able to just fine wearing these shorts really happy again with how everything looks love the color as well too I think the logo is really sweet so definite my favorite feature of the shorts besides the pockets that are deep enough so I'm really happy about that so as you do your shopping online these shorts are definitely true to size so go with your current waist size or your past experience with Under Armour and the sizes that fit you best I only have good things to say about the shorts I really like them very happy with the fit and feel and the color you can't go wrong with black shorts with pockets if I'm getting super picky there is one thing I think I would change but I have to see how it looks printed out and all that it may be resized I wish the logo was on the front completely and not half on the front and kind of half on the side I'd love to see it just on the front and maybe a little bit smaller but again I think they look really cool with the logo and I'm glad it's not on the back side or anything like that either so really impressed so far if I come across anything weird as I'm wearing on the next couple of weeks and months I'll be sure to let you guys know either in the comments section below or I'll follow up with another video

shfSNNWqz04;b'THE BEST GYM SHORTS | THREE NAILS PRO TECH SHORTS REVIEW';b'Brandon Klinger';[Music] [Music] all right what's up guys welcome back to the channel today i have a pretty cool video to show you so i got a package in from three nails clothing i'm gonna do a review of their new protech shorts i actually got pictures of these probably like a month ago from the owner and right when i saw them i fell in love with them and i knew that they were probably gonna be my favorite shorts i had to wait a couple weeks before i actually could get them because they were on pre-order but i finally got the package in the mail today so i thought i would do a video unboxing it for you guys and showing you what they're like the material everything like that just in case you wanted to check them out for yourself there is no secret there's nothing that someone's not telling you that's going to get you to where you want to be ready you need to do everything that you can do every single day to get where you want to be no matter what so these shorts are definitely really cool guys i've never seen something like this from three nails in terms of this specific type of shorts this has definitely been a hot product for three nails and a lot of people seem to like them so i thought i would buy a pair give them a try and then i might get a couple different colors if i really like them but we'll see so i'm going to open it for you guys show you what they're like and then you can decide for yourself if you want to get them or not or if you just are watching this to be entertained that's cool too all right so first thing i noticed was they changed up their branding they got new packages which is pretty cool the three nails logo on the front three nails at the bottom expand the kingdom their mission statement which is pretty cool they used to have just like i think they just had normal polyester bags with no branding on it or minimal branding but these are pretty cool i like these a lot so just for reference guys i usually go for mediums for pants and shorts and then larges for shirts but depending on the material i i fluctuate sometimes but usually mediums and i got mediums for these um so hopefully they fit well oh wow so right away you can tell this is kind of like a heavier mesh feeling these have a liner inside for if you're whatever working out or anything like that i mean you can wear these outside of the gym but i think the whole point of the pro-tec is to use these inside the gym since it has a liner but you can use them pretty much anywhere so they seem a little bit on the shorter end for length but i actually like my shorts a little bit on the shorter side anyways so that looks pretty good very long drawstrings at the bottom which i am definitely a fan of and then on the back you have a zipper pocket on the right side uh so you can keep your phone or pretty much anything else you want to keep in there and on the inside it's just like elastic so overall these are pretty stretchy as a whole the whole shorts are stretchy especially the waistband you can definitely stretch these out a lot and then on the front side here it has their mission statement along with a bible verse which is pretty cool usually for a lot of their products they sell two different types of clothing one of them has their mission statement and then the other one has a cross which is their logo i just like the wording because it seems very minimal and stuff like that but a lot of people also like the cross as well so they sell these in green white and black obviously i got the black um but i think they still have most sizes in stock don't quote me on that it can change by the time you guys are watching the video but last time i checked everything was in stock with the colors but go check the website out if you guys want to see any more of this or any other products that they sell i'm going to link their website down below the length of these shorts is actually perfect i love that they're cut off a couple inches above the knee this is a perfect length for me i just feel like they're too baggy if they go a little bit too far down the knee and then like i said they also have the compression lining on the inside as well which is awesome if you're doing squats or something like that they won't ride up too much like other shorts might like i said the drawstrings are super long which is just kind of like a style thing but i love the look of those and then you got the three nails on the left side as well the pockets on the side are zipper just like the back pocket and the pockets are actually i would say a little bit bigger than most pockets and they're stretchy as well so you can fit a lot in there if you want to in terms of the back pocket uh it's probably about average size very stretchy it seems like you could fit a lot of stuff in here and then i don't know if these are waterproof or not um but either way i love the accent of the white lining around the back zipper so overall guys it's like a light mesh they're actually not as heavy now that i'm wearing them as i thought they were when i picked them up they're actually fairly thin so super breathable definitely definitely going to be nice uh shorts for the gym i'm going to use these a lot i'll let you guys know in upcoming videos how i like these in the gym if i use them a lot so that's pretty much it guys that's the shorts as a whole the link for these is going to be down below make sure you use my discount code bk15 when you check out and you'll get 15 off of these shorts or any other products you see on their website and if you do get something tag me on instagram and i will shout you out of my story what's going on guys so right now i am packing because i'm headed to my parents house for labor day weekend my girlfriend's on the way to the house right now and she's gonna drive with me so i wanted to give you guys an update in terms of my macros they've actually stayed the same since i've started my cut with my coach i've seen steady progress ever since i started and his macros i feel like we're kind of on point from the beginning i've been losing weight and still maintaining muscle and pretty much every check-in with him has been on track so we haven't adjusted anything as the show gets closer obviously there's things that will probably need to be adjusted accordingly just to dial in everything and get my package as tight as possible i'm not sure when those adjustments are going to be made probably within a couple weeks out from the show alright guys but i really got to get packing because i have to leave really soon and the sun's going down and it's about like an hour and a half drive to my parents house and i'm gonna get tired because i always get tired driving late at night so i gotta finish packing but i'll catch up with you guys in a little bit enjoy the rest of the video it's not a game [Music] i have two waters in here um i think i'm gonna keep my long sleeve on looks like from deer that's really weird oh donald trail yeah it's a trail did you not know how long it lasts oh there's two of them how long is that one i don't know what that one is okay let's do it all right guys so val and i found uh this hiking trail it's probably like 40 minutes from my parents house i actually need to do probably like spider web oh oh my gosh oh it's all over me i still need seven or eight hundred more calories of burning for cardio so i'm not actually gonna track how much we're doing but i think that how long is this trail again yes it's like a mile long trail so it's like two miles there and back and i'm probably gonna do cardio later today but then that'll be it for the week and then i'm just going to relax because monday i hit hit it hard again even though it's labor day right now i got the alphalete long sleeve premium tee the three nails pro tech shorts is there elevation on this trail or is it more flat okay you could hear him drop did you can resell that i feel bad taking it [Music] looks like i just woke up thinks he's an outdoors person he's not this is the fifth spider web and there's one up top too ready this is how you do it you just take them you just move them over brandon the hiker i like outdoors no you don't so here we have some beautiful ferns no idea where we're going here's brandon claiming he's a hiker this is what he's hiking in i just ran into another one and the spider was actually on me is it still on me it's like low just down low do you feel it is it a white one no he's eating something yeah what do you mean he'll reset like help me make it it's all done yeah that's that's the stuff i'm running into him not much in the way of things to see quiet hike but a bit boring no lookout but beautiful hike oh you said this one had a lookout this person wrote this huge thing what's that i'm expecting to see like a little bigfoot in here or something oh there's a huge one in front of you look see it brandon that's not a huge spider it's eating something really weird no i think that's its body no thanks for helping it just ruined its home you can make another one we're so weird all right good yeah how far out are we we've been walking for like 35 minutes so i feel like we're lost i want to try this go macros at some point for those of you who don't know my favorite protein bar of all time is met rx they have a couple different flavors i used to get the i think it's like cookie crunch or something like that but i tried the crispy apple pie it's been my favorite protein bar of all time has a has a lot of calories in it but it also has a lot of protein it's actually i think it's a meal replacement bar so if you're like out hiking like we are or if you just forget to pack a meal it's a good option but keep that in mind if you're cutting it's it has a lot of calories but i'm hungry and i didn't eat breakfast really so we need to know all right so i didn't want to finish the review of these shorts until i actually wore them and i thought this hike would be perfect for me to kind of test them out and see how they fit and feel so i'm not sure if it's because of the spandex lining but these are insanely comfortable i think it's because of the combination of the fact that they're really lightweight and then the spandex lining just kind of hugs your legs all right so here's a look at them from the top guys got the long drawstrings they come down almost to the same length as the pants they got rubber on the ends with a metal tip so pretty cool feature makes them feel very premium and then you got the three nails on the left side i tried to show you guys the material it's kind of hard to show but it's almost like this hex pattern and it's very stretchy and lightweight as you can probably tell but the bottom is not stretchy it kind of stays the same size and fits around your leg yeah i was trying to give you guys just a little bit of detail because i'm really picky with my shorts especially when buying a new pair i want to make sure that they're comfortable and what i'm looking for so hopefully that gives you guys a little bit of

5KTItIwHSpc;b'Why I stopped doing tech reviews';b'Rene Ritchie';tech reviews are just broken a new phone or laptop or camera or these days vacuum cleaner hits and suddenly our feeds are filled with like 300 blog posts or podcasts or videos about it because [Music] that's when a company agrees to give a reviewer early pre-release access to a product in exchange for the reviewer agreeing not to release anything about that product until a predefined a predetermined date and time and ostensibly originally that was to make sure the reviewer had enough time with the product to draw an informed opinion about it but mostly to make sure newspapers had enough time to file and edit and physically print and ship and sell all of the reviews without anyone having to worry or stress about anyone else trying to just sneak an advantage by publishing early just to be first there were also very few embargoed reviews for any product back then famously only four outlets had the original iphone at launch smaller papers would follow along eventually and magazines which took longer to publish back then but some also took longer to review it wasn't uncommon for the big publishers to have full-on labs where they had dedicated teams run products through a gauntlet of tests that was about it then the internet happened bloggers and podcasters and video creators a few from traditional media and journalism backgrounds but most just ready to tear all of that down and flip it all around and some companies adapted really quickly to that others just excruciatingly slow some of those companies only or at least initially cared about the numbers how many hits your website got how many downloads for your podcast how many subs or views for your video and if you hit whatever industry threshold that they considered important enough you were in that was it and this was especially true if they had big pr teams or a mix of external or internal pr or local pr trying desperately to manage the expectations of a headquarters outside the us but others only cared about the person and it didn't matter how many hits or downloads or subs or views just the vibe the relationship and the specific audience they wanted to reach or influence in the way they wanted to reach and influence them for even the biggest companies in the world that still somehow had tiny tiny press teams being hyper selective and going deep rather than wide was the only way that they could work and of course when a company is doing well they can afford to be way more selective and harder to reach because everyone is desperately trying to reach them and when they're not doing so well anymore they become a whole lot more generous desperate on their side even because no one is trying to reach them anymore and embargoes are also starting to get just weirder instead of a week or 10 days sometimes they shrink down to 24 hours even less now companies will even do split embargos like you can only do hands-on and read out the specs for the first one and you have to save the review and the opinions for a second one and that feels fine to me when the first one is literally in the hands-on area right after an event it feels really organic really fresh but less fine when they've shipped you the product and it's just because the software isn't working yet but they still want you to get a video up or the one that still really really confuses me is when they pre-brief people before an event let them do hands-on and then embargo it for exactly when the event starts so then i don't know whether to watch the event or watch what is probably a way more succinct hands-on video please just figure that part out at least even the companies who slowly bit by bit year after year started seeding more and more review units which was amazing in terms of access and diversity instead of the same 10 to 12 people we started getting a wide array of 20 40 60 people more sometimes and in some cases we absolutely got better as well fresh takes and fresh approaches but in others we just got more like five more reviews trying to be exactly mkbhd or unboxings trying to be igestine because the flip side of expansion is [Music] back when there were only like a half or dozen reviews each of those reviews got a ton of traffic and shares because they had exclusivity tens of millions of views thousands of tweet shares but now when two dozen hit three doesn't hit all of that attention gets divided up most people still read the verge or the wall street journal watch mkbhd or ijustine and a few other of their personal favorites but no one reads or watches them all nobody can and at the same time most of the hot new products the ones that drove all of those hits and downloads and views over the last decade aren't quite so hot or so new anymore so now we have some people who are getting desperate and just catastrophizing every product launch literally spreading disinformation basically becoming malware just to keep getting clicks and see my toxic benchmark culture video for a lot more on that but also we still have a lack of real innovation from pretty much everyone involved companies and reviewers myself very much included because there are new formats and new versions of the classics popping up all the time ryan tran just reinvented the vlog and it's especially frustrating because i think there's still just a huge market for those deeper nerdier dives the ones that a nantech did and ltt labs might start doing again literally remove the rage bait and focus on the facts also day in the life as well like unlocker does or like jacqueline started doing and joanna stern is just endlessly supremely creative with everything she does and i absolutely think there's room for a new walt mossberg for a massively mainstream reviewer who understands that even really really smart really really intelligent consumers some of them do not care about the technology about the specs about the details at all and they just want to know how the product is going to work for them and which one they should buy and if i hadn't unexpectedly just switched careers and pivoted this channel innovating on the review format was going to be my big focus for the year inspired by justine's last big phone review where she kind of took us along as part of the discovery process that was going to be my plan for the review with lives and shorts all along the way because honestly i saw an existential crisis a threat coming [Music] how long before tech companies figured out they already had tech audiences and started looking for something more instead of mkbhd and their verge they just started giving phones to charlie demilio so her bazillion followers would see them first on tick tock or let mr beast give a thousand unreleased laptops away on event day last to leave wins the key to the park or whatever because it really is disrupt or be disrupted it's blame the world blame the audience or do something about it and i was even trying to get companies to rethink how they handled launches and embargoes to begin with instead of providing samples and mandating utter silence for a week why not just open everything up blow everything up immediately let everyone bring their audiences along with them for the ride not film or photograph the first unboxing but go live with it post shorts and get feedback during the testing field questions in real time let the audience be part of the process not just the final product that would be a trillion times more interesting and compelling to me as a viewer than a trillion canned reviews all posting at the same time in the same way and who knows maybe that'll still happen i kind of think it absolutely has to someone has to innovate some company some reviewer someone's going to figure it all out someone is going to make it fresh and exciting again because otherwise we're just going to keep getting more of the same and be less and less interested in it or more of this which i mean just click on the video and watch it and i'll explain why toxic tech culture made me almost want to quit and distance myself from the community entirely

3qlK4u417Tw;b'Keychron Q2 Review - Your Next 65% Keyboard';b'optimum';[Music] it makes me really excited to see products like this come out onto the market because it was only a couple of years ago i feel we're good quality mechanical keyboards with this weird kind of expensive section of the internet and uh you know now we have boards like this you know high quality pretty decent pricing and actually pretty decent accessibility as well so this is the kikron q2 it's a 65 mechanical keyboard with a volume knob gasket mounting aluminium case hot swappable switches and the fully assembled version comes in at just 160 now for people who are not really into mechanical keyboards that might sound expensive at first but you have to realize how insane that pricing actually is for what you're getting here for what is realistically only 30 to 40 dollars more expensive than some of the most popular gaming keyboards on the market you are getting an absurdly better product here all around now some of you might be familiar with my own keyboard build which i'm currently running which i've done a couple of videos on it's the sixty percent tofu from kbd fans it's using an aluminium case a brass plate quite a lot of dampening foam and lubed gabaron black ink switches now after i built this kbd fans actually reached out and they were kind enough to make this an actual product on their website and so this fully assembled with lube switches this one comes in at around 275. now i think both of these keyboards are great options if you're looking to make kind of your first serious mechanical keyboard purchase both the tofu and the kikron q2 but the question here at this point is like which one is better right should you get the q2 or build a tofu 60 or 65 from kvd fans depending on which form factor you prefer first of all i just want to go over the form factor of the q2 i think that this is really perfect for a lot of people nice and compact while still having the physical arrow keys and that volume knob feels nice and high quality as well it can also be remapped to other things in qmk or via software which is pretty cool this is the smallest keyboard that kikron are currently offering with this build quality and i think it hits that sweet spot between a nice small form factor board but not compromising on what most people feel is essential so just comparing the sizes here my tofu 60 that i have is slightly more compact than the q2 while still offering physical arrow keys and a delete key and that is something that i do have a slight bias and preference towards having said that it's not a big difference at all the q2 is just a bit thicker around the edges but i doubt that'll make a big impact for most people's setups now build quality wise both are pretty even here in my opinion both are a huge step up over your generic plastic gaming keyboard the tofu comes in at about 1.2 kilos whereas the q2 comes in at 1.6 exactly for a bit of reference that is about three times the weight of a ducky one two mini probably the biggest difference between these two boards though is the mounting mechanism of the pcb essentially how the pcb sits inside the case the tofu is like most other mechanical keyboards and is mounted directly to the standoffs of the case whereas the q2 is isolated between these foam dampers this mounting style is called gasket mounting and the main advantage of it is that all the vibrations from typing bottoming out switches bottoming out stabilizers those forces and sounds don't then travel and resonate throughout the entire keyboard if you press down pretty much anywhere on the q2 you can notice just how soft this mounting is the switches on the keys do sink down quite a bit at the same time the pcb feels very locked in doesn't feel wobbly or mushy or anything like that in fact unless you're like a really heavy typer this mounting style will probably feel pretty normal to you in my opinion the main difference is probably the acoustics depending on which switches you're using and how hard you're typing the q2 has a bit more of a bassy kind of rumble to it when typing whereas the tofu is definitely more of a clack solid type of sound as for which mounting style is better a lot of it does come down to personal preference and you know what you prefer in a keyboard but i do think most people will prefer the gasket mounting on the q2 it's just generally associated with a more premium product and typing experience having said that you know this is my first experience with a gasket mounted keyboard and i think this is one of the more exaggerated mounting gasket mounting designs that i've seen and it's nothing crazy to me you know unless you're like a really heavy typer this mounting style is not going to have a huge impact on your keyboard build in my opinion and that's you know coming from a brass plate tray mounted keyboard this is pretty much as rigid as a mechanical keyboard can get but i think if you have some decent noise isolation and foam dampening and you're not an incredibly heavy typo then the difference here is going to be pretty subtle to most people now where there is a noticeable difference between these two keyboards at least the way that i have them configured is in the stabilizers the tofu has modded and loop stabilizers whereas what you're getting on the kikron q2 it's not necessarily that bad but they definitely don't sound nearly as good which is to be expected compared to a custom board the stabilizers here are lubed but the spacebar and the left shift key on my sample at least they don't sound as dialed in and tuned as i would have hoped it's probably worth putting in a little bit of extra lube here i did try that and it did help a little bit but definitely out of the box it's something that you do want to tend to this leads me to my next point which is that the q2 is a hot swap mechanical keyboard and it is really great to see that becoming the new standard and if you don't like the gataron switch options that come with the q2 you can easily swap them out with whatever you prefer instead you could also just buy the bare bones kit that comes without switches and keycaps and then just go ahead and install your own and that is personally what i do see myself opting for and recommending to most people is that barebones kit there are just so many great switch options and keycap sets out there and you really are getting a solid base to work with here at the same time i will say that paying just an extra twenty dollars for a full set of switches and keycaps that is kind of unbeatable when it comes to value now what's really interesting is that if you do go with the bare bones kit for the q2 and then add in the same switches and keycaps that i currently have on the tofu 60 you do come in slightly under the price of this custom board but probably about even once you factor in the shipping from two different stores and overall i do think the kikron q2 is the better option for most people at the moment the biggest advantage over the tofu or most custom keyboards at the same price point would be the gasket mounting the overall better build quality and having the option for a volume knob as well the only downside in my opinion of the q2 are the stabilizers that do need addressing but if you were prepared to lube the stabilizers on a completely custom keyboard then the experience there is really not that different especially if you are starting out with the bare bones kit that does make that task a lot easier to do so again really happy that the q2 exists this is pretty much exactly what the mechanical keyboard market needs at the moment high quality keyboards that are actually available and at low price points i am going to install some new stabilizers and switches and keycaps on this q2 build here the base of the q2 is just too nice not to install and build something a bit more premium with so for those who are interested i will leave it linked down below as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one ;845.0230000000005;1.7750996126732634;299;"['It&#39;s kinda insane to think that during the production of this video, the Q2 which is an absolute banger for the price has already been topped by the much awaited zoom65. Makes me excited for further manufacturers entering into the commercial space making the hobby much more mainstream which will obviously do good for the community', 'I think honourable mention is due to the Akko Mod 005 (65%) and the 007 (75%). Excellent aluminum body, includes metal and FR4 plate and excellent build quality. The Mod 005 is $129 and shipping is way less than from Keychron.', 'IMO the Keychron Q2 &amp; Q1 v2 is the easiest to recommend for beginners since they are great out of the box (FYI, avoid Q1 v1 because of keycap clearance and sound/ping issues). I went with the GMMK Pro as I prefer its aesthetics and the price was also significantly lower since Keychron don&#39;t sell locally in my country. Modded the GMMK Pro to my liking, e.g. PC plate with flex cuts, D65 gaskets, PE foam mod, Durock v2 stabs, ...', 'I appreciate more keyboards supporting ISO layout as a finnish person. I just built a KBD67 lite R3 ISO with yellow gats as my first custom mech. Might build one of these as a gift for my friend!', 'The Q2 is a great option for a aluminium case kit indeed and a great entry in custom keebs. The via support is great to have, something many other are missing at much higher prices. And it&#39;s available, no 1 year wait times', 'Q2 is a great keyboard and I understand you&#39;re not doing a direct comparison of sound, but it should be stated that Black Inks are a linear switch and the Browns are a tactile switch leading to very different sound profiles even when the board/case/foam/plate are all the same.', 'I like what Keychron did with the Q2 but I still prefer the Tofu over Q2. The customization is basically endless. You can play around with different cases, plate, and different mods out there (o-ring mod especially).', 'I wasn&#39;t a fan of the stock caps so I replaced them but for the price the keyboard is great and the sound isn&#39;t bad. It allows for further modifications and stuff but outta dah box, this is a great keep.', 'Curious how this compares with the K2. I got the red K2 because of all the positive reviews and hated almost everything about it: switches, build quality, keyboard height, typing angle, keycaps and sound. I was constantly making typing errors too. Sold it a month later. Much happier with my Drop ALT + Halo Clears. It didn&#39;t have any of these problems.', 'Really love the height of the 65% layout but it&#39;s super hard for me to do without the function row these days. Need more boards with macro pads to the left.']";b'Science & Technology';214112;5482

Their appearance as a common plant was in the mid-Cretaceous period. There are 12,000 species now. [1]<br><br>A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the color green. That is because they are wind-pollinated rather than insect-pollinated, so they do not have to attract insects. Green is the best colour for photosynthesis.<br><br>Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant cover 40.5% of the land area of the Earth, except Greenland and Antarctica.[2]<br><br>Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants. They include the &quot;grass&quot; of the family Poaceae, which are called grass by ordinary people. This family is also called the Gramineae, and includes some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[3] These three families are not very closely related, though all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a similar life-style.<br><br>With around 780 genera and around 12,000 species,[1] the Poaceae is the fifth-largest plant family, after the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae.[4]<br><br>The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland.

create an impactful and successful unboxing video it's extremely important that you understand your target audience and accordingly plan your shots for example for today's product i know the target audience is mostly gamers so these are the people who are most likely to invest their money into things which will make their setup or their workstation look fancy at the same time they would not waste a lot of time watching me unboxing the product but would actually want to watch how the product adds to their entire setup or their workstation so this brings me to the two key points that i need to keep in mind while making the video i need to keep the video space extremely fast this means that it needs to have a lot of fast transitions at the same time i need to emphasize more on the final product so i hope now you guys understand the importance of understanding your target audience and accordingly planning your video so before we start shooting let's talk about my setup the first thing that we need to do is actually choose the right background for our video as an unboxing videos background plays a very important role and sets the theme of the entire video so you can use different car sheets cloths textures to create different kind of backgrounds fortunately for me i have this table right over here and this has a very nice wooden texture to it so i'm going to be using this for today's video next thing let's talk about lighting for today's video i'm using the softbox right over here now in case y'all don't have a soft box you can always make use of window and sunlight that's a very easy way of getting some natural lighting i have a soft box so i'm going to make use of it finally talking about the last thing in the setup that is my mobile settings now we are going to be shooting most of this video in 120 frames per second this is the slow motion mode inside your phones so make sure you make use of it some videos i'm going to be taking in 60 some in 120 so it's gonna be a mixture of both so the shooting process can be divided into three steps number one unboxing the amazon packaging which will lead us to step number two which is showing the outer packaging of our main product then coming down to number three which is the most important one which is how the product looks once we add it to our work desk okay now when it comes to the first part which is unboxing the amazon package this is probably the most boring part of the video because the packaging is very unattractive people don't know what exactly they can expect to see inside so to cover up the unattractiveness of this we will use some transitions and some effects to make it look more interesting and more fun to watch and these transitions will be in camera transitions so you don't need to do a lot in the editing but this will be actually happening in your phone itself just have a look for the first shot i'm going to be taking advantage of the small size of the phone and i'm going to be doing a rotating shot so i'm going to be holding the phone something like this and she's going to be lifting the package finally getting off the package and one two three something like this under that i'm going to be also ending the shot with a swipe down with the phone and i'm gonna be starting the next shot with a swipe down like this so when i connect it in the edit it's gonna look extremely nice now all this might sound complicated right now let me just show you guys what exactly we're trying to do using the 0.5 lens that means the ultra wide lens on the phone because this is giving a larger than life look to the entire product and the subject so it's just you know giving it this really cool looking effect [Music] so as we spoke before the last shot was ended at a downward motion so the next shot will be also starting from a similar motion so that in the edit we can create a seamless transition so we're done shooting the first shot and the second shot guys and now if you edit them together this is what the result looks like so for the third shot guys you're gonna be requiring a stool something like this a small stand or a stool on which you can stand on now this would be used to actually create a top down shot this is very common in unboxing videos and usually professionals use a c stand for this this is basically a tripod which is shaped in a t shape but as we are using things that we can easily find inside our house we are going to be using this tool and i'm going to be standing on it behind and i'm going to be taking the shot something like this another reason these top down shots are extremely important because this angle is really good for giving your viewer a very clear representation of what they can expect inside the product and how the product is exactly and this is the reason you will see top-down shots to be very common in unboxing videos so no matter what you're unboxing make sure to use this angle now keep in mind keeping your hands steady are extremely important for this shot but let's take the shot and let's see how it comes so now that we've got to the main product it's really important that we show the viewers the external packaging as this is an unboxing video every element is extremely important and everything should be showcased properly so i'm just going to be taking some cinematic shots of the external packaging of the product giving my viewers an idea of what exactly is visible on the packaging the material used and just giving them overall feel of what they can expect when it comes to the outer packaging [Music] coming down to the final shots this is where we show the final product and how it looks on the workstation i started out by clearing my desk because i wanted zero distractions in my final shots we have the setup ready for the final shot guys this is the final product i've also cleared out my desk the next thing i'm gonna do is black out the room and we'll start taking some shots so here we are the setup for the final shot is ready i have darked out the room also i've played this video on youtube which adds to the entire theme and the vibe of the product now do understand this guys these are the final shots this is where the viewer decides that if they're gonna be buying the product or no so make sure you go the extra step for this one make sure everything is clean there are no distractions and make it look as aesthetic as you can the one thing i made sure after i started shooting is that i kept the frame extremely tight this way most of the distractions are cut out and the viewer's attention is constantly on the product also for the final shots i kept my camera movements extremely slow this is because we want the viewers to have a proper visual experience of the product and how it looks and after we run with that it's time to start editing but with this we come to an end of the entire shooting process now the next thing to do is actually import our footage to our computers and start editing but before we do that there is a small process that we need to do the first thing i'm going to do is actually open up gallery go through all the footage that we shot today and exactly find the video that i'm going to be using for my final edit although the clip looks great there is a small flaw in it and that is that the entire video is in slow motion and for the final edit i want some paths to be slow and some paths will be fast and we can actually make this change inside the mobile itself so i'm going to go ahead and press on the footage press edit on top so now you can see that in the editor you all have been given two markers these markers actually signify the parts of the video which are in slow motion i want the slow motion to start somewhere over here before she lifts up the box and i want it to end right there something like this okay so now that when i play the footage it looks something like this i think that looks perfect and in a similar way i'm gonna do the changes to all the other footages and then import them to my computer and then we'll start editing so finally it's time we start our editing process the first thing i'm gonna do is hop on to nvidia create a blank canvas because we wanna create a video from the scratch make a video nvidia is gonna uh load a timeline for me now just to save up some time i've already uploaded all the footage that we require for today's edit so we're gonna start off with the first scene which is this particular clip over here okay so i'm gonna first crop it to the start point so i want the video to start somewhere over here something like this now we want to end this video before the motion stops and that is because you want to create a seamless transition with the next clip so that is only possible if the clip is in motion and that's why i'm going to end the clip somewhere over here itself while it's moving and i'm going to press done now the video is going to be imported [Music] okay now i'm going to create another scene and add our second clip into it so again we want to start this clip while it's in motion because you want to create a seamless transition i'm going to start off somewhere over here and we're going to end it somewhere over here and click done let's see how it looks now i think that looks beautiful wow look at how seamless that looks perfect now in a similar fashion i'm gonna go ahead and put the entire timeline just adding the clips and after that we'll add some effects to it so you'll enjoy the time lapse i'm just going to go ahead and add the entire timeline after spending some time working on this i've finally put all the footages in order now the first thing i'm gonna do is actually add some effects to some of the footages so for example uh the footage over here to here i think a transition would look extremely good so i'm just gonna click the square in the middle i think a fail should look good i think that looks pretty cool now at the same time on this particular footage i think a little bit of flare might look good so to add a flare i could just simply go to the left hand side panel uh go to overlays now when video has a bunch of overlays i can choose any one i want simple one something like this i can edit the time on when i wanted to start so i'm gonna [Music] have it come a little later something like this i think that looks nice now with this uh the next most important thing is adding the right music so again i'm gonna go to the left hand side section click on music there are a lot of different different genres available over here so you can just go through and find the perfect music for your unboxing video maybe something in the rock i think i really like this one so i'm gonna go ahead click the plus icon nvidia is gonna add the song for me i'm gonna trim the music a little bit because i want the main part the main beat to come a little bit sooner so i'm going to crop the little bit of the start extend the music a little bit forward [Music] i think that looks really really nice so after this i'm just going to go ahead click the footage click animate and i'm going to be giving this a fade out i think that looks really nice [Music] after this i can go ahead go to my upload section now uh i'm gonna be adding a cinema scope to all the footages these are basically the black bars on the top and bottom of the video i do this for all my cinematic videos i think it's a very simple way to achieve a really cinematic look there we go i'm going to resize it to fit my frame and you all can see now the footage looks extremely cinematic so i'll add these cinematic black bars to all the footages and after we do that this is what the final result looks like [Music]

gmm2b0KFg9g;b'How I Learn Languages | 8 Tips for Success';b'Bella';"In today’s video, I wanted to share some
tips and strategies for learning new languages and maintaining them. To give you a little bit of background, I
speak Korean, English, and Spanish. I moved to the US from Korea when I was 10-years old, so my first language is Korean and my second is English. Around 7th grade, I started learning Spanish
and continued to take it in high school, but forgot a lot of it in the past year, so I’m
trying to get back into that. In terms of proficiency, I would say I’m
most comfortable in Korean and English and I’m in the maintaining phase for these two,
but less comfortable with Spanish and hope to work on it in the future. Language learning is still a work in progress
for me, and a lot of the things I’ll go over today are what I currently am doing as well. When we first start with a language, a lot
of us start by learning vocabulary, which I think makes total sense. Vocabs are building blocks of language and
are super helpful to know before we start doing anything else like writing or speaking. So one of the first things I want to talk
about is how I learn vocab including finding words and making a vocab list. What I used to do when learning English, which
was really not a good idea looking back, was trying to memorize the entire dictionary. In middle school, I remember I got up to something like
letter C and gave up because I wasn’t retaining most of them, and I still didn’t know when
to use the words. Instead, I would suggest finding words more naturally like by reading a book or watching TV. Another simple way is to change the language
setting on your devices to your target language. This way, you know the context of where the
vocab came from, how it fits into the rest of the sentence, and it’ll just give you a better
idea of when exactly to use that word. You can also find words that are more modern
and you’re more likely to use instead of some really obscure word that no one has used
since the 18th century. It’s just more efficient to memorize words
selectively and use your brain space on useful words. Now that we’ve found the words, it’s time
to organize them. I highly highly highly recommend having a
vocab list. I can’t emphasize enough how important it
is to have a list or some other way of storing these words. I used to make my vocab list on paper, but
I digitized it a few years ago so that I don’t have to carry around a physical notebook or
worry about running out of space. I currently use Google Doc, and it’s been
working out pretty nicely for me. I like categorizing my words so that I can
find specific words easily, and it helps me memorize them when they’re clustered like this. As you can see, some words also have a picture
next to them to help visualize. The key thing here is to try different setups and
customizations to find the one that is most helpful. When writing out the definitions, I recommend
choosing a couple of dictionaries to consistently look at. I find it helpful to use around 2 dictionaries
per language because I understand things better when they’re explained to me in two different
ways. In addition to Google dictionary, for English,
I use Merriam-Webster, for Korean, I use Naver Dictionary, and for Spanish, I like Spanish
dict and wordreference.com. If it helps you, you can also write down translations
in your first language. The process of typing the words does force
you to memorize them a little, but it’s important to revisit the words once in a while,
look at the definitions again, write example sentences, so that you actually know when
and how to use them. Vocabulary is one of those things that are
easy to learn but impossible to master. We can’t really stop learning it because
there’s so many words. I think the key to studying vocab is repetition
and keeping at it. When I’m self-studying, I usually don’t
use a specific textbook or a workbook because there’s so much material online nowadays. Many of the resources I use are the dictionaries
I mentioned before. A lot of dictionaries have other features
like practice tools or articles with grammar explanations. I primarily read books and articles and watch
videos to pick up on a language, and look up phrases and pronunciations on a dictionary. But when I need to work more on a specific
topic, vocab, or grammar, I go on different websites and apps like Quizlet, conjuguemos.com,
and SparkNotes. I really like these tools because they’re
very targeted and offer specific help to whatever you’re struggling with. Studying with a book is good if you want a
more structured learning experience, but it’s more than possible to learn and improve off
of these resources. Another amazing resource is people. If possible, I highly recommend practicing
with a friend, a mentor, or anyone who you can interact with in your target language. I know this may not always be an available
option, but something great about technology is that you have different ways of finding
those resources. One of the tools I think would be helpful
is italki. italki is also our sponsor today and here
is a brief message about them. italki is an online language learning platform
that connects language learners with teachers all over the world through 1-on-1 online lessons. They currently offer learning opportunities
in more than 150 languages with 20,000 tutors, who are native speakers and professional teachers. Because there’s a large and diverse pool
of teachers from all over the world, you can find and work with ones from the cultures
or with the dialects you want to learn more about. As I mentioned before, I think having a guide
or a coach to help you along the way can be really helpful. Practicing with another fluent person is one
of the best things you can do to improve your speaking and grammar as you can look to them
as models and get realtime feedback. One really convenient feature of italki is
that there’s no rigid schedules or fixed fees, which means that you can study at your
own pace without a strict time commitment. I think this feature is especially useful
if you’re a college student or someone with a busy or unpredictable schedule as you can
set your own lesson times. italki isn’t a subscription-based service
and you pay per lesson, so you can attend lessons anytime online. I’m putting a link to sign up for free in
the description, so you can check that out after the video if you’re interested. A special event I want to bring to your attention
is language lessons for kids and teenagers. From June 15th to the end of August, italki
is partnering up with tutors who can teach 5-17 year-old students in Chinese, Spanish,
and English. Again, feel free to check out the link below
to find out more about this. Moving on to the next tip. If you do take something away from this video,
which I hope you will, let it be this phrase: Fake it till you make it. Learning a language, essentially, is imitation. We’re replicating how people sound and how
they communicate. Although there’s a big emphasis on speaking
and writing when learning a language, I think it’s super important to listen and observe
before you do anything else. When we’re trying to imitate something,
we have to really look at and analyze it first. This can come from reading books, watching
a movie, watching youtube, or anything that exposes you to that language. This is also where you can spice things up
and make them more fun. Personally, I’m a fan of lifestyle and baking
vlogs on youtube, so I watch these, rotating between different languages. When you watch the things you would normally
watch on Netflix or Youtube or anything else, you can learn new words that pertain to your
own interests and you’re more likely to use in real life. If you’re learning Korean, watching K-dramas
can be both entertaining and educational. They often use realistic and everyday language,
so I would suggest checking that out if you haven’t already. I find videos and shows helpful in improving
my pronunciation as I’m exposed to how native speakers sound. At first, you can turn the subtitles on to
help with comprehension, and eventually, you could try turning them off to see how much
you understand. Another one is listening to songs in different
languages. It’s hard to pick up the lyrics at first,
but it does help open up your ears to what the language sounds like. If you really like a song, you could try memorizing
or translating the lyrics for a more active learning. Reading your favorite book in another language
is a great exercise if you have more time. I started reading 1Q84 in Spanish as Murakami
is one of my favorite authors, and I’m pretty familiar with the plot. When I’m reading in general, I try to keep
a balanced ratio of the languages that I read in. For every English book, I might read a Korean
book or something like that. With Korean, I also read webtoons, which are
online comics. Lastly, social media is a great tool. You could follow celebrities and accounts
that tweet or post in the language you want to learn. It’s hard to know what people these days
actually talk or text like just from textbooks and educational material, so social media
can show us a more realistic usage. It's just a really good way to learn more about their culture as well. I think pronunciation is one of, if not the
most difficult part about learning a language. Some sounds in one language simply don’t
exist in other languages, and it can be really hard to grasp what certain words are supposed
to sound like. But once again, pronunciation is imitation. It’s listening to a lot of native speakers
and trying to sound like them. One thing I found really helpful in learning
to pronounce things is by recording myself. I use a simple recording app on my phone or sometimes
the camera to listen to what I sound like and compare my pronunciation to recordings
of natives. This way, you find patterns on how you’re
saying specific things and can make adjustments if needed. When I’m learning to pronounce an individual
word, I might also go on Google and search “How to pronounce blank.” It gives you the slower version as well, which
is pretty nice of them. Another thing you should consider is that
there are different dialects in languages, and you should probably pick one to study
or begin with. Sometimes, even the grammar and spelling can
change with different dialects within the same language. This could look like using the same dictionary
consistently or watching media with the same dialect across. I would say stick with one, really master
that one, and if you want to branch out to other regions, feel free to do that after. This is more on your mindset when learning,
but don't be afraid of making mistakes, especially with pronunciation and grammar. The more mistakes you make, the more you learn. And this is really painful and embarrassing
at the time, but the worse the mistake, and the more times you make that mistake, the
better it sticks in your mind. I myself have made some traumatizing mistakes
before, and after that, I usually don’t make that same mistake again because it’s
literally tattooed on my brain. The moral of the story is that before getting
it wrong and getting told that it's wrong, you're not gonna know that it's wrong. I think it's actually better to make more
mistakes because then, you'll have the chance to correct any possible misconceptions. Learning a language is almost like a process
of elimination. What Google translate and books tell us can
be really general, so the only way for us to realize how and when to specifically say
a word or a phrase is by trial and error and human feedback. If you're at a stage where you're comfortable
with 2 or more languages and are looking to maintain them, you could consider translating
or transcribing captions for different websites or archives. TED Talk is the first one that comes to my
mind, but there’s a lot of other opportunities if you just google. Most of the videos you’ll be working with
on TED Talk are educational as well, so we're learning new things on the way, contributing
to meaningful projects, basically killing 3 birds with 1 stone. Writing subtitles for my youtube videos helps
me in the same way, keeping me on my toes and encouraging me to keep learning, picking
up new vocabs, and sustain my fluency. A lot of youtubers leave a link in the description
box where you can contribute to their translations, so that's another thing you could explore. Language is fast-evolving and there’s constantly
new slangs and trends you might want to keep yourself updated with. Translating youtube videos could be a great
way to help you with this. Keeping a diary in your target language is
another long-term activity that can help you maintain that language. Since keeping a diary or journaling tends
to be a habitual thing, it’s a good way to keep using a language, and it’s usually
not a big time commitment. You could take like 5 to 10 minutes each day
writing a few sentences, or even just 1, and it’ll keep that language fresher in your mind. Lastly, it’s super important to stay motivated
and excited about learning a language as it CAN be a long process and there’s going
to be times when you aren’t picking things up as fast you’d like. To keep yourself engaged and motivated, it
helps to keep thinking about WHY you want to learn this particular language. Have a specific goal in mind, maybe you want
to study or work abroad, travel without language barriers, or learn about a new culture. For me, most of my motivation came from wanting
to read books in other languages and being able to talk with my peers and others around me more fluently. It also helps to break down those goals, which
can be pretty broad and long-term, into smaller steps. This could look like watching a movie without
subtitles, holding up a short conversation, reading a book or keeping a diary in that
language. I think it’s important to pursue smaller
short-term goals to allow yourself to feel a more immediate gratification, all the while
still having your final goal or dream at the back of your mind. This concludes today’s video on ways to
learn languages more effectively. I hope this was helpful, and another shoutout
to italki for sponsoring this video. See you next time! ";843.2729999999999;2.8294514350631412;808;"['I am Korean and I am learning English, Japanese and Chinese. Later, I want to learn Spanish and French too! Everyone who studies languages, cheer up!', 'I also wanna add to the language learning tips!<br>1) With the vocabulary list, after writing down the new word and its meanings, use the word in a sentence. Remember, the whole sentence must be in your target language. This way you can strengthen your knowledge on how to use the word and it actually makes it a lot easier to remember  (depending on how many times you used it in a sentence.<br>2) During the familiarizing phase, it&#39;s a lot better to watch something first before reading something. It&#39;s a lot more efficient when you see and hear the language you want to learn about instead of just seeing it. This also help you be more aware of the intonations to use so even when you come across an unfamiliar word you would intuitively know how it would sound like (it might not be necessarily accurate but it&#39;s good enough; you would also feel more confident about yourself when you guessed right on how to speak that word ^^ at least that&#39;s how it is to me :P)<br>3) Visualizing is your friend.

So let me clear up a few things. This is not about the best option, this is about money saving options. We have been doing this for several years with success. If you do not think that this will work for you scroll along. If you don’t like the size of the mesh that we filter our dirt through, pick one that works for you. Dirt contains bugs! If you start your seeds inside and you would like to use this option I recommend boiling water for the dirt first. We use a greenhouse, which you can clearly see in the video. This is a wonderful money saving option for homesteaders who start seeds outside or in a greenhouse. If you’re going to take the time to leave a comment, you could at least read the other comments. If your soil is too compact this probably isn’t the option for you. If you start seeds inside, this probably isn’t the option for you. Please use common sense. Yes we use solo cups as pots.

Any cutting you take will have the same type of fruit as that tree, but the tree might not behave the same way. Hope this helps!

8OHY8QMw-AA;b'Can You Monetize Sports Highlights on YouTube?';b'Jacob C Edmunds';can I monetize sports highlights on YouTube well the short answer to that question is yes but the long answer is a little bit more complicated than that so keep watching if you would like to hear my experience with monetizing sports highlights on YouTube though I have dabbled in posting several different sports highlights the majority of my experience is with basketball highlights most specifically NBA highlights and that is going to be the basis of what I share today so I first got into posting sports highlights on YouTube in 2015 when I started a YouTube channel called the gym or watch which was highlights of Jimmer Fredette I enjoyed watching Jimmer in college and a few years into his professional career I decided to start a channel posting his highlights and just see what would happen and I didn't really see a ton of user much traction at first but I didn't really care I was just doing it for fun fast forward a little bit and Jimmer goes over to China it was a lot harder for people to find highlights and watch his games so my channel started picking up some speed because I was really the only place that people could find those highlights I still wasn't getting crazy views like maybe 5 to 10K views per video until he scores 73 points in a game and that video blew up pretty much overnight it is one of the most viewed videos on my channel it had more than 500 000 views and I had all kinds of people reaching out to me like ESPN and stuff like that asking if I own the rights and that was pretty crazy now at that point my channel was not monetized I was only 16 at the time and I wasn't really sure if I was allowed to make money off those videos so that was in February 2017. later that year I actually moved to England and served a two-year mission for my church so I was not able to run my channel I left it in the care of my brother and another friend of the channel they kind of took care of things while I was gone and then once I came back in the fall of 2019 I was ready to pick up where I left off and I decided to apply for monetization at that point so the first time that I applied I was actually rejected from the YouTube Partner program and I kind of figured that that was probably for the best you know I don't own the rights of the videos whatever it was worth a try and I just kind of moved on and I kept posting the videos for fun but I kind of gave up on my dream of getting monetized then fast forward about a year and I was bored during the pandemic and I decided to apply for monetization again and this time I actually got accepted and I was able to monetize the videos on my channel and in fact a week later Jimmer Fredette scored 70 points in a game over in China and once again the video blew up it got over 300 000 views and I actually made over a thousand dollars on that video and as far as me not owning the rights to it in China they actually have different copyright rules for sports broadcasts Chinese courts do not classify Sports broadcasts as something that is protected by copyright now I'm not a lawyer so don't take my word for it but my understanding of the rule was that I was allowed to make money off that because of the rules that they have in China and none of those videos that I've posted highlights of Jimmer in China have ever been copyright claimed or anything like that I've never had any issues however at that point Jimmer was over 30 years old and he was kind of coming to the end of his career so what I ended up doing is changing the channel to cover all basketball players and renaming the channel to enzyme Hoops now this is where things start to get interesting in the beginning of 2022 I started posting NBA highlights on my channel and things started taking off even more so than what they were doing when I was posting just a gym or for that highlights at that point my channel had been kind of dead for a while because Shimmer wasn't playing and I hadn't really posted anything but as soon as I started posting NBA player highlights then My Views and subscribers started increasing exponentially so I started posting NBA highlights in about March of 2022 when my channel was at 6 000 subscribers and it had been at that number for a long time but after just a month of posting NBA highlights I gained like a thousand subscribers and I was actually able to make money off these videos through YouTube AdSense basically what would happen is each time I uploaded one of these videos it would get claimed every time but I would actually still get paid for the views I got before the claim happened and there's quotes of Adam Silver saying stuff about why the lead doesn't crack down on Highlights channels and stuff like that so I naively thought that what I was doing was okay I kind of thought to myself like this is a pretty good deal I get to make highlights of basketball a sport I love I get to get paid off it then once the NBA claims it then they get the rest of the revenue and it's kind of a win-win for both parties and it's also marketing for the NBA because people who watch my highlights are also more likely to watch a live game or a full game on TV well that little pattern lasted for about a month until YouTube demonetized my channel now it's important to note here that it was not the NBA that stopped this from happening this was something that was flagged inside YouTube YouTube flagged my channel for posting reused content and basically I was uploading like 10 videos every night and every single one of them was getting copyright claim so it's not very surprising YouTube would see this channel that is part of their YouTube Partner program that uploads like 300 videos in a row and every single one of them gets copyright claimed you're probably gonna go check that out and I wasn't really surprised to get demonetized anyway I was told that I could reapply for the partner program in 30 days if I removed all of the videos that were copyright claimed so I did that and I reapplied I was able to get re-accepted nice and easy and at that point I kind of laid low until NBA Summer League in July of 2022 well I didn't really learn my lesson and once summerly came around I started uploading tons of highlight videos again and at first most of these didn't get claimed right away so I thought great this is awesome I found something that works for me but eventually they all started getting claimed again and in about the same time frame as last time about a month my channel was actually demonetized for a second time so this was pretty discouraging for me and kind of started the beginning of the end I reapplied a third time after removing the infringing videos and I was able to get accepted again and this time I tried doing little things to get around it like deleting the videos as soon as they received a copyright claim or adding voiceovers to the highlights and stuff like that but ultimately the claims just kept coming in I tried really hard for about a month to only post highlights with voiceovers from myself on top of them and hopefully get away with it under fair use but every single one of those videos still got copyright claimed and when I would dispute the claims the dispute would get rejected I escalated a lot of these disputes to appeals but it became exhausting because I had to dispute and then appeal every single video on my channel that I posted in order to get paid also when you appeal a claim the person who filed the claim has the option to take down your video which will give you a copyright strike and if you get three copyright strikes then your channel gets terminated as well as any other channels that are associated with that channel so where I was uploading like maybe four five six videos every day I was putting myself at a large risk of getting my channels terminated because if the MBA just decided one day all right we're done we're gonna strike all six of these today then there's no way that I would be able to get my Channel or my other channels back they would just get terminated so ultimately I decided to stop making those videos I kind of gave up because first of all I felt a little uncomfortable about making money off of something that wasn't mine and also if it was that hard for me to make like a few dollars per video then it probably wasn't something that I should be doing so I just decided to call it quits and to move on from that I was also putting myself at risk of legal repercussions who knows it probably wouldn't happened with Adam Silver as the current commissioner but the MBA would have a very good case against me for copyright infringement if they just pull up my channel they could sue me pretty easily and I really wouldn't have any defense so to protect myself from that as well I thought it was best to just cease posting those videos and that was really hard for me to just give up and walk away because I had been posting basketball highlights for about seven years and I love it but ultimately it was time to walk away and I actually could have kept posting the highlights on my channel and gotten outside sponsors there's a lot of channels that do that they post NBA highlights and have outside sponsors and then they make money from that instead of from AdSense but personally I just felt a little uncomfortable about that a little guilty and even paranoid and so once again I just decided to stop now don't get me wrong I'm not here to tell anybody that they shouldn't do that or that's not allowed or then I'm going to report them or something like that's totally fine if you want to do that it just wasn't for me so the long answer to can I monetize sports highlights on YouTube is yes but if you do so you put yourself at risk of demonetization termination and even legal repercussions hopefully my experience was helpful to you if you have any questions about what I shared feel free to leave them down in the comments and I'd be more than happy to answer any questions you have if this video helped you please leave a like And

Now I also got paranoid about any legal action and decided to trim all the highlights from the videos. I lost 2.5 of my 4 million views because you can’t edit a video that has more than 100k views and had to make those videos private. Now I’m moving forward with posting the videos with no possibility of getting a copyright but also no monetisation.

Thank you, and I subbed to you.', 'Bro, this video comes quite at a good time. As you dealt with basketball, I deal with surfing. In many of my videos, either I take all the footage from wsl (world surf league) yt channel and do some quick edits, either I take multiple footages of surfers channells and put it in one video, either I take one surfer&#39;s video and make it shorter (ie my video my video that did almost 100k two weeks ago). So, my channel uses stuff from other creators and I reuse content. AND IT WORKS !!! (that&#39;s the problem). I took a video of 8mn, and made it two minutes. I put a music behind. And easy 100K views. And I have many videos like you that perform well (many of them are around 20k while I take world surf league footage entirely). I am never copyrighted by world surf league.

Long ago their was a war so great that the six gods themselves came down to fight in it. The demons were banished and destroyed but when it came time for the gods to aced back to the heavens, they found they were stuck in the mortal realm. To punish the island for trapping them, they left a curse before they died like mortals. Nobody could ever leave the islands, “bone wall currents” (currents so dealt that the bones of ships had built a wall in them from the chaos) would trap anyboats from leaving. The kingdoms on the island separated by species, elf, nymph, fae, and such… but the humans built a walled city and convinced themselves they were the only ones left. My MC lives in that city and meets her half brother for the first time since they were kids, and finds out he is Demi-Fae. When the kingdoms leaders find out Rhea (the mc) and Carys (her half brother) are criminals and theives, they are banished along with all other criminals to the outside of the wall, a place where it was presumed they would die. But something inside of Rhea stirs, magic. They find out that they both are The God’s Accendants. Along with four others. They would be tied to one of the gods and it’s element, and one day have to die so that the gods could go back to the heavens and rule once more. But, to break the curse on the dying  island, they can’t do this. To save themselves and their rag tag team of accendants, Rhea, the accendant for the queen of the gods, must team up with the “demons” that the gods had originally “died” to vanish in the Great War. Along with the handsome demon prince.', 'I want to do that!! 😂 I want introduce my character by committing a murder 😂😂😂', 'I love when the main character is introduced by committing murder', 'Haha, The book im writing <br>&quot;He dropped dead in front of me&quot;', 'OMG THIS SOUND IS PERFECT 💀💀']";b'People & Blogs';179210;23256

Once upon a time, Elliot was Macy’s entire world—growing from her gangly bookish friend into the man who coaxed her heart open again after the loss of her mother...only to break it on the very night he declared his love for her.\r<br>\r<br>Told in alternating timelines between Then and Now, teenage Elliot and Macy grow from friends to much more—spending weekends and lazy summers together in a house outside of San Francisco devouring books, sharing favorite words, and talking through their growing pains and triumphs. As adults, they have become strangers to one another until their chance reunion. Although their memories are obscured by the agony of what happened that night so many years ago, Elliot will come to understand the truth behind Macy’s decade-long silence, and will have to overcome the past and himself to revive her faith in the possibility of an all-consuming love.\r<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br>Subscribe  @USA TRENDING BOOKS  \r<br>Follow us on \r<br>Facebook - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/usatrendingbook"">https://www.facebook.com/usatrendingbook\r</a><br>Pinterest  - <a href=""https://www.pinterest.ca/usatrendingbook"">https://www.pinterest.ca/usatrendingbook</a>', 'Me: Please don&#39;t say a C.

XGDESdh9w1c;b'7 Tips For Painting Fast, Loose, & Bold In Procreate (#Shorts)';b'Rishi Draws';here are seven tips for painting fast loose and bold in procreate number one skip the sketching phase instead set up a grid with a reference and dive right in painting without a sketch will help you loosen up but the use of a grid will keep you from going completely off the rails number two use an opaque brush this way you can efficiently layer strokes on top of each other to quickly make corrections to your drawing and values number three don't blend just lay down one stroke at a time using a bold flat brush and color pick from your reference to find the perfect in-between values number four follow the contours of the shape and if it's a face have your strokes follow the planes of the face number five use a large brush to avoid painting too many details too soon and only start using a smaller brush towards the end number six don't zoom in this way you won't be tempted by small details and finally number seven push through the ugly phase we all have it and believe me it will pass just take a deep breath and trust the process and that's it i hope these tips help you paint bolder more spontaneous paintings i personally love this loose expressionistic style it's something photos can't achieve to me that's what makes it special ;117.27600000000002;1.9782393669634022;1656;"['Aaahhhh yesss, the &#39;ugly phase&#39;, it can be hard to push through ;) Nice tips Rishi!', '“Push through the ugly face/Phase”\xa0is really inspiring.

I think in the past 30+ years I&#39;ve only had to ask forgiveness twice and asked to delete pictures once by a mom who was in a protection program and didn&#39;t want pictures of her daughter taken.

our electromagnetic field nice and energized with this posture so keep your elbow straight
keep the arms nice and strong Breath of Fire is a very cleansing breath
a very energizing breath so it really sets us up for a very great Dynamic active day

in the center of the brow just above the eyebrows and take a deep inhale hold that breath in
as you bring the thumbs to Touch Above the head squeeze mulbandh so you're squeezing
anus and sex organs pulling the navel in and feeling sensing imagining that energy moving
from tailbone up the spine to the crown of the head open the fingers out wide stretch
the hands out why keep the think the thumb tips touching and exhale comb the hands down
through the auric field bring the fingertips to the Earth and just relax here grounding
through the fingertips feel the weight of the physical body feel the ground beneath
you now we're going to continue our activation through the auric field inhaling the hands
up with the Palms together above the head exhaling the hands down with the Palms facing
away from each other so you're turning your palms in the direction of the movement inhaling
up exhaling down and this Aura sweep is a really great practice for every single day
just to build up this lovely energetic field around the body to cleanse this auric field
and to build up the protection that it offers you it offers a very lovely psychic protection
keeps you safe from negative energies as well as little rogue viruses that might be around
so building up with this breath with the movement keeping the arms straight keeping the eyes at the third eye point that's it nice and strong with the breath

the body with the spinal Flex inhaling forward exhaling back nice full deep movement full
deep breath as you open up through each of the 26th vertebrae good keep the eyes rolled up and into the
third eye Point keep the navel strong to the spine just to protect the spine not extend
over extend the spine particularly if you're very flexible in the lower back the chin stays roughly parallel to the floor and you're going at your own pace if you're
feeling slow and steady today slow it down if you're feeling even faster than I'm going
move it with a dynamic breath really opening up the spine opening up the
chakra system getting the energy flowing through the trunk of the body good hands up onto the knees now as you continue
this movement continue the flex opening the spine to the front to the back moving as deep
as the spine will allow keeping the navel engaged that helps to intensify
this little passive massage on the digestive system getting the digestive juices flowing that's it these spinal flexors are great for
keeping the spine youthful and supple also excellent to keep the chakra system aligned
and balanced lovely movement for the chakras come into the center now deep inhale hold
that breath in squeeze mulbandh stretch up tall lengthen and exhale relax release Turn
The Palms to face up Gian mudra and just settle into the Afterglow again of that beautiful
movement and breath how it feels in the body inhale deep exhalefully now we'll bring our
hands onto our shoulders things at the front thumbs at the back and we'll inhale twist
to the left exhale twist to the right again you want your navel really strong for
this one to protect the spine the eyes are rolled up and into the ajna the
elbows are lifted great for releasing stagnant energy in the
spine and also to open up the heart to open up the circulatory system that's it keep it going strong navel supporting
the spine coming into the center deep inhale hold that
breath squeeze mulbandh stretch up tall through the spine lengthen exhale relax release floating
hands down to knees Gian mudra just staying present noticing this incremental blossoming
of energy in the body and incremental Awakening of your consciousness inhaling deep exhaling fully and for our final
little burst of Kundalini energy we're going to just give ourselves a shake out so shake
out your hands shake out your arms shake out your shoulders shake out your head if you
want to release your legs out in front of you and give them a good shake shake it shake
it shake it Loose shake your hips that's it shake your ears shake your elbows shake your
shoulders Shake everything your hips your knees your feet shake it shake it all out
and remember to breathe as you shake so you're just shaking out any little bubbles of tension
in the body you leave no cell unturned keep it shaking keep it breathing keep it moving
there's nothing like a good shake to awaken ourselves up to awaken our Kundalini that's
it to release tension to release stress it's a very natural movement to get rid of any
excess energy in the body any unhelpful energy in the body and take a deep inhale stretch
up and exhale float the hands down to Gyan mudra and we'll just rest here for a moment
allowing those energies to settle feeling the rapid heartbeat feeling the Ragged
breath tuning in with yourself this awareness that we find between every
Kundalini Yoga movement is the real Gem of Kundalini Yoga it brings us into a connection
to ourself so no matter how short your practice is if you have connected to yourself in this
way you have done your work take a deep inhale exhalefully and another
deep inhale just to slow the heartbeat exhalefully and one more for good measure
deep inhale and exhale let's bring our palms together in our prayer
mudra feel that connection between the Palms feel the spine straight the shoulders relaxed
chin tucked in eyes at third eye and we'll chant our satnam just to seal this warm-up
Kundalini Yoga practice mini booster numb and bow your chin to your chest offering
