# Discussion

- No Control Group. (We essentially compared Personas High SSC Individuals and Low SSC Individuals Simulated by an LLM)
We have no idea how real people would react to our explicit study setup with the Shorts. Only the concepts and topics were replicated from the study
But for a better setup we should have had 4 Groups (2 LLMs and 2 )

- LLM won't contradict current scientific consensus, since it is trained on it, so any other result would have been highly unexpected
