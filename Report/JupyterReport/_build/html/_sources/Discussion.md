# Discussion and Reflection

## Lack of Control Group
The study notably lacked a real human control group, a critical element for comparing against the simulated LLM responses. This absence hinders our ability to gauge how actual individuals might react in the same setup. Although the LLM replicated the original study's concepts and topics, the lack of real participant data as a baseline significantly limits the study's external validity. Future studies should consider incorporating four groups – two with LLM simulations and two with real human participants – to provide a more robust and comparative framework.

## LLM's Alignment with Scientific Consensus
A key limitation of the LLM is its inherent alignment with current scientific consensus, stemming from its training on existing knowledge. This characteristic likely skews the study's outcomes and limits its capacity to explore unconventional or novel perspectives. Recognizing this limitation is crucial in interpreting the results and in the design of future studies.

## Influence of Emotional Concealment Directive
The directive for participants to "try to hide your emotions" had a significant impact, especially on responses from high SSC personas, compared to those from low SSC personas. This discrepancy suggests that the instruction might have introduced a variable that disproportionately affected one group. Reconducting the experiment without this directive could provide a clearer understanding of its influence. Preliminary experiments indicated that omitting this directive might skew results towards the higher end of the scale, suggesting a need for a more balanced prompt that minimizes undue influence on participant responses.
