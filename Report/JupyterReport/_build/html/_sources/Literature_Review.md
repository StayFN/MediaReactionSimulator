# Literature Review

Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate human social behavior is relatively new. Croissant et al. {cite}`croissant2023appraisalbased` have conducted research to test whether LLMs can simulate believable human emotions by challenging the LLMs to solve emotional intelligence tasks. The researchers show that LLMs are able to simulate emotions in gaming contexts and role-playing scenarios which dictate high emotional complexity. While the researchers were able to produce promising results, they state that their research is only a first step in the direction of emotion simulation using LLMs. However, they conclude that LLMs seem to be able to successfully perform such tasks although further research is required. Törnberg et al. {cite}`törnberg2023simulating` have performed similar research by simulating human interactions on social media. The aim of the study was to build and validate a framework which allows to test the effect of different social media algorithms on human interaction and the quality of conversations. Realistic personas with different attributes and world views were created with the help of data from the American National Election Study. The researchers conclude that LLMs hold considerable capabilities in simulating social behavior. They further suggest that LLMs could be used to conduct social experiments which would be to dangerous to perform on humans subjects and could erase ethical dilemmas. However, Demszky et al. {cite}`demszky2023using` suggest otherwise. The researchers outline major concerns about the application of LLMs in the domain of psychology and argue that LLMs are not yet ready for many psychological applications. However, they also provide solutions on how their concerns can be overcome to increase the usability of LLMs in psychology.

Reinecke & Meier {cite}`reinecke2021media` have constructed a model which integrates self-control and entertainment theory. Therefore, they provide a theoretical explanation of the central self-control components and introduce the AMUSE model. The AMUSE model systematically builds on available empirical evidence regarding the effect of sate-control on the selection, processing, and entertainment effects of media content. Moreover, they provide testable propositions to conduct future research. In their research, the authors reference several papers from which they derive the propositions. In the following some of those papers are depicted since their described experiments were simulated during our research:

Muraven et al. {cite}`muraven1998self` conduct several studies. Their studies showed that suppressing emotions and forbidden thoughts decreased the stamina of participants or their ability to control their expression of amusement and enjoyment. The researchers suggest that high state self-control increases the capacity of individuals to control their emotions when watching humorous videos. Schmeichel {cite}`schmeichel2007attention` conducted several experiments which tested if efforts at executive control undermine subsequent efforts at executive control temporarily. For our research experiment 2 is relevant as it showed that high state self-control increases the capability of controlling the own emotions when watching gruesome videos. Further, Johnson et al. {cite}`johnson2015self` tested in their research, if individuals with reduced self-control experience greater levels of enjoyment during the exposure to the narrative of a short-story. The researchers found that participants with depleted self-control experience significantly higher levels of enjoyment, audience response, and transportation than individuals with high self-control.

Stucke and Baumeister's research {cite}`stuckeEgoDepletionAggressive2006` investigates the hypothesis that the capacity to inhibit aggression is a limited resource that becomes depleted with the exercise of self-regulation. They conducted three experiments to examine whether individuals who have recently exerted self-control would show increased aggressive responses.
In Experiment 1, participants were asked to resist eating tempting food. Those who resisted eating later showed more aggression in response to an insult compared to those who were allowed to eat freely. This was measured by the negative evaluation of the experimenter.
Experiment 2 involved participants stifling their emotional and physical reactions while watching a boring film. Similar to Experiment 1, those in the self-regulation condition exhibited more aggression (in the form of negative evaluations) following an insult than those in the control group.
Experiment 3 replicated the setup of Experiment 2 but included additional measures to rule out mood as a confounding factor. The results again supported the hypothesis: participants who exercised self-control by suppressing reactions to the film later showed greater aggression towards the experimenter after provocation.
The study concludes that acts of self-regulation, such as resisting temptations or controlling emotional and physical responses, can deplete a person's capacity for self-regulation. This depletion increases the likelihood of aggressive responses when provoked. These findings suggest that the ability to inhibit aggression is indeed a limited resource, affected by recent exercises in self-control. The research highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of self-regulation in preventing aggressive behavior, suggesting that maintaining or strengthening self-regulatory resources could be key to reducing aggression in society.

<!-- Transition to research question-->
While there already exists research simulating human emotions using LLMs and investigating the effects of self-control on human affective reactions, there has not been any research trying to simulate and reproduce appraisal theory experiments using LLMs. Therefore, we tried to replicate a selection of the experiments which yielded the propositions described in the AMUSE model by Reinecke and Meier {cite}`reinecke2021media` to answer the research question if *Large Language Models can be used to simulate human affective reactions to media content using appraisal theory*.
