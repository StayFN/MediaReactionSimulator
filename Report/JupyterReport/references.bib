  abstract = {If self-regulation is a limited resource, the capacity to inhibit aggressive behavior should be lower among people who have already exercised self-regulation. In Experiment 1, participants who had to resist the urge to eat tempting food later reacted more aggressively to an insult than other participants who were allowed to eat as much as they wanted. In Experiments 2 and 3, some participants had to self-regulate by making themselves concentrate on a boring film and stifling their physical and facial movements, and afterward they, too, responded more aggressively than controls. Experiment 3 also showed that the results were not due to differential moods and that one act of self-regulation (unrelated to aggression) was sufficient to enhance subsequent aggressive responses toward the experimenter.

    abstract = "{From flirtatious glances to a passionate kiss to the explicit depiction of sexual intercourse, sexual content in entertainment has historically enjoyed wide appeal. This essay reviews the scholarly literature on the nature of sexual depictions in entertainment media and discusses people’s attraction to, and enjoyment of, these depictions. Drawing from studies in entertainment, psychology, and sexual motivation and drive, the appeal of sexual content in media is argued to be the result of a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social interactions that inform our appraisal of a sexual depiction as serving or hindering our hedonic need for pleasure. Sexual depictions that emphasize romantic relationships are also discussed in terms of fulfilling nonhedonic needs, wherein vicariously experiencing sexual activity within a relational context might serve an inherent need to find meaningful connections with others and with humanity as a whole.}",
