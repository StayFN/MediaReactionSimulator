# Media Reaction Simulator 🚀📊🎥

## Expanded Overview 🌐✨
This repository now encompasses a specialized implementation for testing propositions from "The Oxford Handbook of Entertainment Theory" by Vorderer and Klimmt. Our pipeline, incorporating advanced scraping, metadata extraction, and feature analysis, integrates with a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate user reactions to YouTube Shorts. This approach facilitates an in-depth exploration of media entertainment theories, particularly focusing on user control and affective responses.

## Advanced Features and Implementation 🌟🔧
- **Topic-Based Scraping:** 🌐 Refined to target videos aligning with theoretical concepts under study.
- **In-Depth Metadata Extraction:** 📝 Now includes viewer engagement metrics and additional relevant parameters.
- **Feature Extraction:** 🔍
  - **Words Per Minute (WPM) Analysis:** Analyzing speech variation patterns over time.
  - **Emotion Extraction:** Utilizing NLP techniques for nuanced emotional expression analysis.
- **LLM-Powered Simulation and Analysis:** 🧠 Replicating and analyzing studies, focusing on:
  - **Proposition 2.1 Analysis:** Examining the relationship between control capacity, motivation, and affective reactions.
  - **Proposition 2.2 Exploration:** Investigating how control factors influence reappraisal of affective responses and goal prioritization.

## Case Study: Testing Propositions 2.1 & 2.2 📚🔬
We conducted a case study focusing on Propositions 2.1 and 2.2 from [Media Entertainment as Guilty Pleasure? The Appraisal of
Media Use, Self-Control, and Entertainment (AMUSE) Model by Reinecke and Meier](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190072216.013.12)

- **Proposition 2.1:** "Control capacity and control motivation negatively predict the intensity of both positive and negative primary affective reactions to within-media events."
- **Proposition 2.2:** "Control capacity and motivation moderate the reappraisal of primary affective responses to within-media events, with low self-control favoring short-term mood management goals, and high self-control favoring higher-order goals."

### Methodology:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered a diverse range of YouTube Shorts.
2. **Feature Analysis:** Applied emotion and speech pattern analysis.
3. **LLM Simulation:** Simulated user reactions based on control capacity and motivation levels.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Compared LLM-generated reactions with theoretical expectations.
