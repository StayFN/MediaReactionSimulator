# YouTube Shorts Analysis Pipeline 📊🎥

## Overview 🌟
This repository hosts a pipeline for scraping YouTube Shorts based on specific topics, extracting metadata, and applying feature extraction techniques. The core functionality involves feeding the extracted data into a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce textual summaries of the short videos. These summaries, along with the video features, can be used to simulate different theories of media entertainment research. For instance, by providing the LLM with a summary, a definition of a specific concept (like the AMUSE model), and a persona, the LLM can simulate a user's reaction to the content, offering valuable insights for entertainment media research.

## Features 🚀
- **Topic-Based Scraping:** 🌐 Automatically harvests YouTube Shorts based on a predefined list of topics.
- **Metadata Extraction:** 📝 Captures vital metadata such as captions, titles, comments, and descriptions.
- **Feature Extraction:** 🔍
  - **Words Per Minute (WPM):** Measures the speech speed in the video.
  - **Emotion Extraction:** Identifies and extracts emotional expressions from the content.
- **LLM Integration for Summarization:** 🧠 Employs a Large Language Model to effectively summarize the video content, enabling simulations of various media research theories like the AMUSE model.
