Comments: ['Story time for people who are bored:<br><br>It&#39;s 4 am and my mom woke up due to hearing what sounds like a hyena laughing, she realised it was me because I saw Enid&#39;s face at the end and burst out laughing. I am known for sounding like a hyena when I laugh so now I am running to ohio to escape her belt<br><br>Update: After my 527 hour long trip, I&#39;m in Ohio and it&#39;s eternal darkness. While running, a dog ran up to my mom and bit her belt off, the dog is now chasing me and my mum found a portal and went to the wild West, got a whip, and got back. Now I am running from a dog and my mother, I then proceed to go into a rocketship, and now I am I space.<br><br>75 likes for part 3 (tell me when I&#39;m there and  if I get the notification I&#39;ll update)<br><br>Part 3: it is space and I am running, since there is no gravity in space, I tripped and flew to Mars, while I was on Mars, a person at NASA saw me while using a very good telescope and then Elon Musk flew there too. Me, my mum and the dog got a medal for the first person on space, first child in space, and the first dog in space. We were all astonished but my mom is from another country, her English isn&#39;t well and its not her first language so when speaking, she accidentally said &quot;race&quot; and then Elon Musk decided to race on who could get back first, so I came up with a plan.<br><br>100 likes for part 4 but since I am at 97 likes I&#39;ll do it anyway<br><br>Part 4: I would dig to the other side of Mars, reach its core and since my mom is lavaproof, she takes it and we go back up. We wait for it to freeze and then we jump on and go, so we did and then as we were flying out, Mars&#39;s gravitational pull got us to the other side and flung us forward because we got out of orbit. Elon saw us through their space craft and turned on extra speed.<br><br>125 likes for part 5+6!<br>(I need to sleep and go to school around now and its at 121 likes, feel free to press the like button but I&#39;ll update after I come home from school, so please don&#39;t comment &quot;125 likes now update&quot; because I&#39;ll update it after I come back)<br><br>Part 5:  We saw a shooting star and we got on it, it headed past earth but due to the winds on venus, it pushed us back on earth very quickly, we just hit the atmosphere and started burning, the shooting star was burning up, but luckily, it went through the ground and went through the core, and then we won a prize for the deepest person alive, the lava was made out of molten iron, so I decided, &quot;what if we melt this?&quot; Then shrek came in and poured swamp water down, but now, the earth wasn&#39;t warm anymore. Remember that portal to the wild West? We went through it.<br><br>Part 6: my mom remembered that she is chasing me, and I started laughing, but.... NOW I SOUND LIKE DUCK, and then random wild animals started chasing me and now I am running from,  1 mother, 1 dog, 826 wild animals, but I was OVERHYDRATED so I just couldn&#39;t run any longer, so I came back to ohio and got some prime dehydration and then used the hole that I dug up earlier with the shooting star and fell to Australia, well atleast there&#39;s now an exit to ohio!

Me, my mum and the dog got a medal for the first person on space, first child in space, and the first dog in space. We were all astonished but my mom is from another country, her English isn&#39;t well and its not her first language so when speaking, she accidentally said &quot;race&quot; and then Elon Musk decided to race on who could get back first, so I came up with a plan.<br><br>100 likes for part 4 but since I am at 97 likes I&#39;ll do it anyway<br><br>Part 4: I would dig to the other side of Mars, reach its core and since my mom is lavaproof, she takes it and we go back up. We wait for it to freeze and then we jump on and go, so we did and then as we were flying out, Mars&#39;s gravitational pull got us to the other side and flung us forward because we got out of orbit.

Remember that portal to the wild West? We went through it.<br><br>Part 6: my mom remembered that she is chasing me, and I started laughing, but....

Comments: ['Story time for people who are bored:<br><br>It&#39;s 4 am and my mom woke up due to hearing what sounds like a hyena laughing, she realised it was me because I saw Enid&#39;s face at the end and burst out laughing. I am known for sounding like a hyena when I laugh so now I am running to ohio to escape her belt<br><br>Update: After my 527 hour long trip, I&#39;m in Ohio and it&#39;s eternal darkness. While running, a dog ran up to my mom and bit her belt off, the dog is now chasing me and my mum found a portal and went to the wild West, got a whip, and got back. Now I am running from a dog and my mother, I then proceed to go into a rocketship, and now I am I space.<br><br>75 likes for part 3 (tell me when I&#39;m there and  if I get the notification I&#39;ll update)<br><br>Part 3: it is space and I am running, since there is no gravity in space, I tripped and flew to Mars, while I was on Mars, a person at NASA saw me while using a very good telescope and then Elon Musk flew there too. Me, my mum and the dog got a medal for the first person on space, first child in space, and the first dog in space. We were all astonished but my mom is from another country, her English isn&#39;t well and its not her first language so when speaking, she accidentally said &quot;race&quot; and then Elon Musk decided to race on who could get back first, so I came up with a plan.<br><br>100 likes for part 4 but since I am at 97 likes I&#39;ll do it anyway<br><br>Part 4: I would dig to the other side of Mars, reach its core and since my mom is lavaproof, she takes it and we go back up. We wait for it to freeze and then we jump on and go, so we did and then as we were flying out, Mars&#39;s gravitational pull got us to the other side and flung us forward because we got out of orbit. Elon saw us through their space craft and turned on extra speed.<br><br>125 likes for part 5+6!<br>(I need to sleep and go to school around now and its at 121 likes, feel free to press the like button but I&#39;ll update after I come home from school, so please don&#39;t comment &quot;125 likes now update&quot; because I&#39;ll update it after I come back)<br><br>Part 5:  We saw a shooting star and we got on it, it headed past earth but due to the winds on venus, it pushed us back on earth very quickly, we just hit the atmosphere and started burning, the shooting star was burning up, but luckily, it went through the ground and went through the core, and then we won a prize for the deepest person alive, the lava was made out of molten iron, so I decided, &quot;what if we melt this?&quot; Then shrek came in and poured swamp water down, but now, the earth wasn&#39;t warm anymore. Remember that portal to the wild West? We went through it.<br><br>Part 6: my mom remembered that she is chasing me, and I started laughing, but.... NOW I SOUND LIKE DUCK, and then random wild animals started chasing me and now I am running from,  1 mother, 1 dog, 826 wild animals, but I was OVERHYDRATED so I just couldn&#39;t run any longer, so I came back to ohio and got some prime dehydration and then used the hole that I dug up earlier with the shooting star and fell to Australia, well atleast there&#39;s now an exit to ohio! And then the animals brought a BOOMERANG, they tried to slice my head off, but I dodged it....<br><br>150 likes for part 8-9<br><br>Also before you comment &quot;you should&#39;ve uploaded it by now it&#39;s been 6 hours&quot; I&#39;m so sorry but I had an appointment and went art supply shopping and I came home and completely forgot, sorry!!<br><br>BTW, should we just bomb this comment on March 1st?

"," This YouTube short is a critique of a video game created by PETA, an organization known for promoting animal rights and veganism. The game, called ""PETA's Racist Game,"" features a protagonist named Nugget who embarks on a journey to find the Golden Tofu, which has the power to turn anyone who tastes it into a vegan. The game is described as a point-and-click Choose Your Own Adventure style game, but the creator of the video notes that it is mostly filled with unfunny, dated jokes. The video highlights the game's mixed messages, such as ignoring the suffering of chickens being cooked alive, and its use of stereotypes, such as the Chinese stereotype of Tofu Manchu. The creator concludes that PETA's game is problematic and does not effectively promote animal rights or veganism. The comments section includes viewer reactions, such as criticism of PETA's tactics and disagreement with the creator's assessment of the game."
