NLvfrxL3YGA,Chinese Spacecraft Rolls Out Of Control During Dangerous Landing,Scott Manley,yesterday the three astronauts from China's sheno 16 Mission returned to Earth this is normally a rough process re-entering the atmosphere deploying a large parachute dumping the peroxide Fuel and then descending to a landing which is cushioned by a rocket motor this time there was some serious roll going on you can see the capsule is moving sideways relatively quickly and when the rocket motor fires the spacecraft bounces off the ground and then begins tumbling as the load is removed from the parachut I've seen speculation that the sideways speed was due to a damaged parachute but I can't say that for certain and it was clearly very windy this would have been a rough ride for the crew but it's not clear it would have injured them the capsule was obviously well protected and the crew are supposed to fold their arms to hold them from flailing around sheno is very similar to soyu and NASA found that onethird of NASA astronauts were suffering minor injuries during suu Landings I'm interested to know but I don't expect similar transparency from the Chinese space agency ,121.76,1.5440210249671489,0.1017013712544439,1.0,0.1736164736164736,0.24126478012488373,0.4693168660748741,0.9652214236030605,0.3135285317375498,0.19364161849710904
