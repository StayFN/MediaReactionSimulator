The Greek term doesn’t imply cowardice or weakness. In the Septuagint, the word was used as an equivalent for a Hebrew word that can be translated “meek” or “humble.” It was used with reference to Moses (Numbers 12:3), those who are teachable (Psalm 25:9), those who will possess the earth (Psalm 37:11), and the Messiah. (Matthew 21:5) Jesus described himself as a mild-tempered, or meek person.

HDr5FOY9Xv8;b'Its a HAUL!! SHORTS!!.. Fitness, sexy and comfort shorts';b'Florina Fitness';[Music] so as promised we are doing that short haul that I told you guys about I wanted to do it earlier but I had to do a couple of returns do the dirty work for you guys cuz a lot of things came up we can like [ __ ] feeling like [ __ ] just the quality was so terrible so I did return a lot of things and bought other stuff and I finally think I narrowed it down to a few of my favorite things so we're gonna jump into it let's do the pink ones alright so these are I love these probably my favorite and that's these are super stretchy so um that works for me I like the color I'm very into like pinks and moms and all that shebang so I like it for that feels good on the tissue let me tell you is it squat perf I don't need I didn't even check is that squat prick yeah yeah all right so let's squat proof um you can obviously go a little larger if you want ever got at home I go for a smaller you know I don't care I like teasing this one all day long so there are a little short so if you don't want any accidental butt cheek slippage I would go one size up and I think you can still pull it off and look really good I like him a lot I think I have a long pair of leggings like this also that I ended up really loving so I think that's what like attracted to me to them at first but I like it anything oh right in the butt crack large maybe you can't go any [ __ ] sometimes it's only from small to large other times they do have extra-large if you're lucky so I don't know I guess maybe maybe good luck I hope there's an extra large if you want bigger it's not you're gonna have some chi-chi's coming out moving on to the next one there are these dark grey longer shorts let's try that alright I really like these um I had a pair on in one of my last workout videos it was a great pair from Old Navy they were cutting circulation by the end of my workout um but I tried too large and it looks silly I had a lot of material like here anyways they were tired or than I thought these are not as tight there's a lot of space in there which is nice they shot the button good I think right all right baby but that's that's happy look I really like them I like that they're forgiving this color is always gonna be forgiving but yet still show off your curves whereas like if I get black Vili you can't really see the curve but if I get like a dark gray you can see the curve as well as it being forgiving if forgiving is it if you have any cellulite it won't show through which is really nice but um I like it there's space on the legs I just broke another damn seam when I put him on I broke a semen now he just it's good thing they're cheap um it's a good thing they're cheap I wouldn't care if I'm all over again anyways I love them they're cheap they look good motherhood cheap is an expensive Amazon I will link them all for you guys um these are size medium you can size up if you want I actually I may have got I almost would go with a large if I did it again and that's just because once I work out my legs get super pumped and then as your side's just broke seams which isn't really a big deal because there's elastic to it now this leg will be nice and loose but if I had to do it again I probably would get a large but I'm so happy with it love them I absolutely love them I love the link moving on to those purple short ones I love the design of these I keep playing my hair because I'm actually really hot all this changing is making me hot I like the side pockets they are actual functioning pockets and they seem like they go on forever my entire hand fits in there both sides but the pockets also give me more hip egde I don't have hit I have booty but I don't really like that's that's your natural build you can't create hips you can't squat and get bigger hips such as my natural build then it kind of fills in that area I feel so kind of like it that's a booty probably said they're a little tight but he likes them a lot cuz he says they make me look very fit you're fit Thanks I think I mean I hope years of working out makes it but no what he means is they look that good they're very smooth they just look good they let your booty shine even though they are tight there's a lot of stretch to it um so overall I do like it you do get a little bit of camel toe I'll tell you now so wear your panty liners ladies because it does rise after some time and if you wear a penny liner it helps with that obviously take it off after your workout for those who are gonna be like don't suggest people wear panty liners because of yeast infections you're gonna get yeast infections if you keep that [ __ ] on all day but I mean a workout one hour won't give you a yeast infection but it will prevent the camel toe other purple ones that these are longer and cute oh we're gonna okay so I really like these um they're a bit loose like these when I said things were stretching nothing is as stretchy as these pants let me tell you they're very stretchy so I do like that the waistband is really cute but let me tell you if you snap out like that snap it on you it hurts so yeah I don't know why whatever it's made from it hurts like a [ __ ] really bad another thing I noticed which is not a deal-breaker for me I just have to wear the proper underwear is you do see like your underwear through it um and the ones I'm using have like sewing and and stuff you know they're fancy so don't wear fancy ones and wear like the laser cut that have very little detail but I have that and you can see that through them I notice not a deal-breaker just change your underwear I think the butt looks pretty good there's a lot of space and what I love is it keeps me like it's not tight at all noise but it's not like loose and sticking out ugly but then there's space for your booty you know so it's just you can have a bigger butt and it still looks really good there's a bit a waist these are large and the last ones I put on were also a large but these are way more compressed that's how they feel when you put these on these are very very like I don't the fabric is just so loose and like putting them on those breeze so I like them I like them a lot why don't I men's a purple apparently right huh we're getting more colors what do you mean we're getting more colors oh definitely buying more yeah I absolutely love it they feel good I feel like even after my muscle pump I'll have space to breathe so I absolutely love him obviously I absolutely love all of them because I did try them on previously and I made sure to you know show you guys just the best things I don't want to have a fail where it's like oh I hate these and then I wasted your time this was like month of shopping you're welcome and then I could wear them like pretty wear them because everyone would ask where are they from and then that would kind of defeat the purpose of the hall and I wanted to do the hall mostly so that when I wear them I could just rec do there because everyone always asks where'd you buy this where'd you get that where'd you get that and either forget bar I never provide that link I say I might provide so this way it'll all be on this video now you're welcome a lot of dirty work was that we're gonna get to like funner pants maybe more home style stuff things that I like to tease him with and yeah Netflix and chill kind of hands so hey those blue ones the velvet when I was saying about teasing him talking about this obviously these are cheeky I wouldn't I wear them in my gym because I work at it oh but I wouldn't be wearing them out these are just super super comfortable let me tell you they aren't velvet but they're like stretchy like super stretchy um and I love that about them they feel soft on the skin no itch they got the right amount of Chicot shipping so I do like them I had to size down dramatically for these like I said if you don't want any booty cheek is showing and you do want to wear them out you can size up I'm wearing small small first I got a large and I'm like these don't cut it it covers everything baby he's like I agree return so I'm just play to the sizing these are small intentionally small because gotta keep him you know interested going into the rose pink also velvet all right so these are tighter than those I don't know I probably would have gone up a size now that I'm like I put him on before and I didn't think they're this tight they feel much tighter what do you think would you want me to go up a size no no you like them they don't squeeze too much no okay super cute color I love it like I told you guys I'm into mobs Pink's and all that stuff so I do love that I actually have a lingerie piece similar to this and I love it too so I knew I was gonna love it right off the bat I just have to buy more colors in it but um almost the same thing just these were a little bit looser you know they're small Thanks medium these are medium they feel Tigers and they feel tighter than the smells but yeah intentionally I went smaller you can always size up but yeah I like like come on moving on okay these are they're interesting they're interesting alright so when I said interesting interesting also he will always be able to spot me you'll never lose me now that I'm gonna go anywhere with these I don't even think I'll work out in these they're just really cute um there are teas I like them for that reason something like this I would probably wear with like a baggy t-shirt of his where you can only get a peek or something I love the waistband on this I'm obviously I'm kind of into that if you haven't figured it out yet with these pants - I like it it's nice these are just super cheeky shorts meant for the house these will never go outside but I do like them a lot I really do moving on another pair is similar to these but I found a matching top and well fell in love so yeah this one just put it on walk out the room normal minding your own business and see what happens what happened he likes this much a lot same bottoms they're both mediums but these felt way tighter so I might just be like the pattern you know how like sometime materials different so even though other mediums these actually feel a little looser the is things a cheap outfit like it doesn't cost a lot of money so you're not going to get like top-notch quality the thing you notice most is that where my butt is biggest it starts to fade the obviously the more you pull the more it fades you can fix that by going one size down but I don't think you would have liked it size up my bed I don't think you would have liked it I've probably been like it's too big just a cute outfit I like it how's the one I will tell you you know that you would tell me to leave you along this why cuz he won't let me grab you hey don't tell me why I don't let you grab me I let him grab me he's just a little too handsy sometimes but no I really like it I like it a lot it's just a cute outfit that you know sometimes you want to be a [ __ ] and teasy I love you baby I love you we're gonna go to two other outfits they're also like two-piece pajama and Netflix and chill kind of things so this perfect outfit to sleep in Netflix and chill it's just super comfortable at first I was like I think it's a little big because it is kind of like there's extra material there but I think I like how big it is like I don't I don't mind do you mind would you wanted a smaller bigger would you like it how it is yeah the top is a little bit loose in certain areas but I think I also like that too that what you don't always feel so like oh you know you can't breathe into that I think I'm buying more colors for sure this little lace detail right there I don't know it looks really cute I like it I like it a lot it goes all the way to the to the butt cheek to sew all around but normally when they have things like this I'm usually turned away because they they're not like stretchy and fitted they're like flaring out and you look silly in my opinion for those who have that and like it I'm sorry I apologize in advance I do not like um it takes away from your booty it looks kind of silly to me anyways moving on I love this one I'll tell you guys why once after I put this outfit on hubby's like I just see you walking around with a champagne glass and I'm like really I see fluffy slippers and coffee we spend New Year's Eve by ourselves that's what that's your by ourselves you know what never happens though but yeah I'll wear it for you if it does happen I promise okay reason why I love it velvet mauve pink this one's more on I wouldn't call it too much pink right it's not as pink as like the others ha it's almost rose gold maybe you can say rose gold um I do like it I think if you loosen the straps you can you know get a little bit of girls if you want to be a little bit more sexy yeah I don't mind covering your like this down baby yeah he's like I didn't know that was an option but yeah you can loosen them a lot I think um and get them lower if you want pimp I love they bubble up here which is the only thing I don't like but it wasn't expensive so clearly like it's fine so female it was it I wasn't invited if you see you loosening all the straps everything so overall I just love this outfit if there are more colors I'm going to get more colors that's the booty comfortable stretchy yeah so those are the outfits that's everything nicely jump in you see coffee and we always argue about this because you'll be like oh you look so sexy like that I'm like no I do not this is gross he's like what is wrong with you like I don't know we just both make very different we perceive Beauty very differently anyways I love all the outfits I hope you guys do too everything absolutely everything will be linked right even that's pink top I wore to show you guys how it looks I'll link that one - it's linkable and that way I will direct you to this video every time I do wear a piece you probably won't see a lot of these so you won't really be asking about them because I'm pregnant I'm gonna show them again in a video but just see yeah maybe
