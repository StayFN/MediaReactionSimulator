Greaaaaattttt fun. That was utter agony...I remember I was lucky to have had a thong on my foot while wandering around in the shallows. It could have been waaaay worse if the spines had been able to dig in deeper. I remember my foot being submerged in an esky of water, though I cant remeber if it was boiling water or cold water. Probably one and then the other. That was agony for about 12 hours...i remember the pain stopped at around midnight, which was veeery late for a kid my age in the 80s to still be awake....as soon as the pain stopped, I fell asleep and didn&#39;t wake until almost lunchtime the next day...other than a really itchy leg, from the swelling, I was absolutely fine. I was around 11 or 12 iirc. I still have pics and a diary entry somewhere lol). I was super lucky to have a dad that was a master mariner and skippered heaps of boats on the East Coast, the Gulf of Carpenteria and Torres Strait.....so he dragged me along whenever he was able to. At the time, taking all the sunburn and seas sickness into account...I took it for granted....now however, I realise just how lucky I was to have had mad adventurers for parents, and how lucky I was to grow up on boats... from about 1yr old as well (I think my mum demanded to be on a trawler with me and Dad rather than have a screaming baby in a caravan in the 44°c heat at Kurumba....apparently I almost got washed overboard about a squillion times....due to all sorts of stuff from Cyclones through to my own curiosity...I must have been curious about how fast a toddler can sink and turn into crab food lol)<br>Its possible that your parents may have known my father or mother (I have the same name as my dad)...It was a pretty small community until Cairns exploded in size in the late 90s and 2000s. My dad retired from skippering around the mid to late 90s....though he&#39;d take his boat out of Mourilyan Harbour, where he retired to, out fishing at every opportunity. <br>I got to spend many school holidays at Mobiag Island in Torres Strait, while my dad was running the MV Kennedy as a cray fishing mothership....I also got to stop off at every single island between Makay and Torres Strait to count bird populations, when the Marine Parks leased the game boat that my dad was skippering...for 6 weeks or so. That was a fantastic trip. <br>Yes.....we are super lucky to have had such an amazing childhood.....its impossible to describe the experience of early morning or late afternoon on a boat while underway...the smell of the sea...the colours and the quality of the light. Or sitting on a beach on a tiny deserted island with a small fire and the stars outting on a show like no other....running through the small waves and kicking the water up coz it was phosphorescent. Also free diving on the reef or walking around on a reef at low tide by myself at around 7 or 8ish....magical...i remember feeling and thinking &#39;this mist be waht its like on an alien planet&#39;.....that was before parents were so overbearing, though im sure my dad had his eye on me lol. I was born in 76 ...so I got to see the reef in the 80s while it was totally pristine. Amazing. I wouldnt swap it for all the money in the world.....I miss it and am close to deciding on either a b I ock of land....or a yacht. Its gonna be a haaaaard choice lol. <br>Subbed!', 'Quiero en dos años máximo tener mi propio velero']";b'Travel & Events';58852;1473

CRHR-TSY41c;"b""Why They're Called Knots #sailing""";b'Lyfe Untethered';in the old days Sailors didn't have these so they used knots to measure their speed let's see how fast we were going in knots in the 1600s Sailors used what's called a chip log to calculate their speed a triangle-shaped piece of wood the chip attached to a line or log line the line had knots every 14.4 meters exactly 1 120th of a nautical mile they'd throw the chip overboard and the triangle shape would kind of hold it in place Sarah wouldn't hold still so they pushed me overboard the log line would spool out and they'd count how many knots were let out over the course of 28 seconds measured with an hourglass if they counted 10 knots they were going about 10 nautical miles per hour a nautical mile is about 1.15 miles per hour so 8 miles per hour is about 7 knots watch this video to see if we died ;85.36;1.8509840674789129;633;"['☠️ See if we died! <a href=""https://youtu.be/ERZZe8F01MY"">https://youtu.be/ERZZe8F01MY</a>', 'It’s crazy how going over water makes you feel like your going faster.', 'Let&#39;s take a mile which is already not a great unit and divide it into 120 parts cause why not, and then we&#39;re going to time it by using 28 seconds as a standard... knots also known as potatoes per bananas.', 'We still call it knots...
