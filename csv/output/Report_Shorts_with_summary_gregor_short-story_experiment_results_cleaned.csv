3, so you should start on dinner right away. - Yes, Miss [distortion] Smith  - Okay, you ready? - Uh yeah, but I want to check on Lily first. I'll meet you in the car. [Ms. Smith] Okay MIA, I'm off to work.  Lily's asleep in her crib.
[ominous music] MIA? MIA? [music intensifies] - Hi, Miss Smith. - I'm off to work. Lily's asleep in her crib. - Have a good [distortion] day at work. [text alert] [Lily crying]
[ominous music] [music intensifies] [front door closes] - MIA I'm home from work. Mmm smells so good in here. Is the turkey almost done? [broiling] [coughing] [coughing] - [News Anchor] We interrupt your regular scheduled 
programming for this breaking news story. A bug in the latest MIA operating systems is 
causing irregular behavior. Please refrain from using your Mia until this issue is resolved. We now return to your regular programming. Happy Thanksgiving. 
Comments: ['Which country are you watching from?', 'Never leave your baby with an obviously malfunctioning robot. I suspected that this would be getting heavy and dark as she was shown cutting up the vegetable. And you did not disappoint, man, that was HEAVY. Very well made though, no shocking effects but all the more psychologically horrifying.<br>Thank you for your efforts, Alex. I appreciate this very much. Your shorts are fabulous.<br>Thank you to all involved, great job guys!<br>Have a splendid weekend!', 'What I like about this story is how real it can be with all this AI stuff. Great video as always', 'the girl who played mia did an awesome job! she&#39;s so good and scary lol.', 'HOLY MOSES 😮😮<br>Alex you just combined M3GAN with Thanksgiving and made an even darker movie that I thought possible. I had a feeling once I saw the baby things would get scarier and boyyyyy did they. Excellent job bud, you just outdid Eli Roth for BEST Thanksgiving movie of the year, and Clara deserves an Oscar for that performance no question 😊 cannot wait to see more from you my friend', 'Man, the quality of these shorts is amazing!!! Skills for reals!', 'Well, damn, if that wasn&#39;t dark!! The ending said it all!! Your content is becoming far more sophisticated and disturbing. Take that as a huge compliment!! Well done!', 'Happy very late Thanksgiving! 🦃 this was really scary and MIA gave me a very unsettling feeling the entire time, especially when cutting the vegetables! Keep up the good work!', 'Happy thanksgiving Alex and to everyone watching.  This was another great short and little more disturbing especially to think what if this actually could happen.  Again well done❤❤❤❤❤❤', 'This was really great!, very creepy!.Great job ACM!❤']

on the pavement and the photographs up my skirt which were published under on the front of the English tabloids the next morning if they published the photographs 24 hours earlier they would have been illegal but because I would turn 18 they were legal it makes you very afraid of being bold of of being brave of really going for it after years of being harassed by the Tabloid Emma was desperate to pull away from the public eye are you considering pulling out I never really spoken to you about this yeah I think um I think I was scared the fame thing had finally hit home in a big way we never

Channel: b'Life Stories By Goalcast'
Transcript: Emma Watson is being blackmailed after speaking out I was immediately threatened the website's shows were countdown with the words Emma you are next threatening to release naked photographs of me since she was a child she's been stalked and sexually targeted we never talked about it on the film because we were all just kids there was only one Harry Potter co-star she could really trust Tom was the one harm couldn't stop the attacks so angry just raging this is like a real thing that's really happening now the blackmailers will stop at nothing to ruin her life will Emma be able to stop them there was a website that was set up threatening to release naked photographs of me with like a countdown I was just just raging made me so angry ah they were threatening to release naked pictures of her users from the controversial website 4chan were threatening to release the pictures of Emma as Revenge but this wasn't the first time Emma fell threatened for years she's been targeted and preyed upon SNL produced a skit titled Hermione's growth spurt when Emma was just 14. with Harry Potter they like are making him look small and you know young and Goofy and innocent but with her they're like trying to make her yeah like a sexy school girl my transition into Womanhood was dull very differently and the older she got the more Obsessed the media became with sexualizing her British tabloid the son printed a countdown to her 16th birthday which is the legal age in the UK and what should have been one of the best nights in Emma's life turned into a nightmare I came out of my 18th birthday party and photographers lay down on the pavement and the photographs up my skirt which were published under on the front of the English tabloids the next morning if they published the photographs 24 hours earlier they would have been illegal but because I would turn 18 they were legal it makes you very afraid of being bold of of being brave of really going for it after years of being harassed by the Tabloid Emma was desperate to pull away from the public eye are you considering pulling out I never really spoken to you about this yeah I think um I think I was scared the fame thing had finally hit home in a big way we never talked about it on the film because we were just kids I was never going to turn around and be like hey how you doing like is everything okay although Dan and Rupert never noticed Emma's Payne there was one person who dead the more I saw and understood what her life was like the more empathy I had for her I became very defensive com was the one I could often be more vulnerable with for years Emma has loved and admired Tom I walked into the room where we were having tutoring the assignment that had been given was to draw what you thought God looked like and Tom had drawn a girl backward cab on a skateboard and I just don't know how to say it I just fell in love with him is that he turned me when he's like oh I see her in like a younger sisterly way and it just broke my heart little did she know Tom was hiding how he really felt my girlfriend at the time knew straight away that there was something unspoken between us I remember using the familiar old line I love her like a sister but there was more to it than that I've always had a secret love forever Emma thought she was alone and her fear of putting herself out there kept her from living her truth I was very insecure I was constantly fighting The Fear Factor I think it was incredibly difficult for her some people just didn't understand that although Emma was on the outside it allowed her to see what was really going on my girlfriends started dropping out of their beloved sports teams because they didn't want to appear muscly my male friends were unable to express their feelings Emma realized she had to speak up for herself and others because nobody else was we are launching a campaign called he for she we want to end gender inequality both men and women should feel free to be sensitive both men and women should feel free to be strong Emma Watson's gender equality speech proved she's becoming a groundbreaking activist it had never been about being an activist it was about the choice to make myself visible but little did she know that by making herself visible she was actually putting a bigger Target on her back within less than 12 hours I was receiving threats Emma Watson has been targeted by internet trolls on the site which hosted naked celebrity photos the website shows Watson next to a countdown with the words

you find yourself missing a piece you're sitting in a classroom the teacher is up front going into detail about a new assignment you're confused and everyone around you seems to be paying attention and you know that if you just did the same you wouldn't be confused but there's something about the room or the teacher or yourself that's getting in the way maybe it's just the way he's phrasing

people are staring you try not to stare back it's rude nice of you to join us the teacher says this is the time this month he continues with the lesson you try your hardest to focus and pay attention and take in what he's saying just listen it's not hard just listen and everything will be so much easier what is he even saying oh God this always happens can I please just listen you're on the train home you look at the next stop screen reciting each station in your head how many times have you been here how many times have you done this you've made it home you're exhausted you don't know why you didn't even get anything done today it would make sense being destroyed if you've gotten something done but your brain is fried without the results to justify it and that's when you realize you forgot to ask about the assignment whatever you'll just ask him tomorrow and why didn't you tell me sooner well I was meant to but it slipped my mind for two weeks it's been two weeks yes it's been two weeks right well um uh actually what have you been doing in class the past few weeks what have you been doing nothing absolutely nothing but you can't tell him that that'll never be enough so you find yourself making something up that convinces no one but what else can you do two weeks two valuable weeks gone wasted it's due by the end of the week and you have nothing absolutely nothing to work

running out of time you're running out of time you look at the sticky notes on your wall they're good at keeping track of what you've failed to do with what you haven't even tried to do all the promises you've made to friends teachers and yourself that you've broken in time it's not like you want to let people down you wish you could do the opposite sounds like it should be so easy but no matter what you do you find yourself somewhere else entirely it's at this point that they may have thought of this assignment sends you into a spiral of Despair are you just doomed to be like this forever with life of constant noise and distraction and disappointment you start to wonder how long you'll end up stretching this project out until you can finally get it done all hope seems lost you're alone and exhausted and finally a bottle a small white bottle Dex amphetamine the doctor said five milligrams twice a day it's the only thing you haven't tried so you try it and it's like putting on a pair of glasses after a lifetime of not knowing just how blind you really were it helps good ,623.0400000000001,1.630713918849512,6452,"['&quot;You&#39;re exhausted. You don&#39;t know why. You didn&#39;t even get anything done today.&quot; Is my life almost every day.', 'As a teenager with severe ADD, this video perfectly described the struggles in a person’s daily life. This video portrays ADHD in a way that isn’t just the dumb “I’m so quirky because I can’t pay attention” stereotype. It shows what really happens when it goes unmediated, such as not being able to finish things you’ve started, not being able to find things that are in plain sight no matter how observant you are, and not being able to keep track of time, thinking that 2 hours were just a couple of minutes.', 'This changed my perspective of ADHD so much. I have a friend with ADHD, I don’t have it so I’ve never really understood it, whenever the teacher calls on him and he doesn’t know the answer, my teacher gives him a lecture on listening and I see him shed a tear. I thought he was lazy, never listened in class, chatty, then cries when he gets an answer wrong, I thought he was dramatic, but this really helped me learn more about ADHD, thank you for this.', 'strangely I can cope with my ADHD during school years because the schedule from the school helped me a lot to keep track of everything, was a struggle to stayed focused during class but the adrenaline to get a high score made it exciting so I got high score sometimes. But, now, as an adult. It’s getting hard to keep on with my project. Just like her, drinking water and eating, one day passed just like that. There were times where I made peace with ADHD but there were also times where I feel disappointed at myself. Living with ADHD is hard. It’s not as easy as ‘just do it’, I want to ‘just do it’ but my brain freezes then I get nauseous. Cheer up my fellow ADHRers', 'As someone who&#39;s been considering having adhd for awhile, this video really cemented it for me. The amount of times the hair on my arms raised during this because it felt like a callout specifically to me was insane, this was so beautifully and accurately written and filmed. &quot;You&#39;re exhausted. You don&#39;t know why. You didn&#39;t even get anything done today.&quot; perfectly describes my day to day life, and I severely hope to get diagnosed in the near future. Thank you for creating this', 'I&#39;m not diagnosed. I don&#39;t wanna self diagnose but I feel this video is a perfect example of how I feel. I have talked to my therapist about it. Turns out I have a sub category of ADHD called ADD. This video made me want to cry. That&#39;s exactly how I am..', '&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me about this sooner?&quot; Hits hard for me. especially when the truth is always labeled as a &quot;lame excuse, try something better next time&quot; from boss figures and teachers', 'i was diagnosed earlier this year. today i mentioned it to my dad, as i thought he knew since it&#39;d been a while. he didn&#39;t and he said a lot of surprisingly hurtful things, but mainly that he was certain i don&#39;t have adhd despite my diagnosis, and that i&#39;m just &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;without discipline&quot;. it was a very upsetting experience that&#39;s been weighing on me all day, and opening youtube and seeing this on my recommended was strangely comforting', 'I was actually diagnosed with ADHD since my teenage. I suffered severe depression and mental disorder. Not until my mom recommended me to psilocybin mushrooms treatment. Psilocybin treatment saved my life honestly. 9 years totally clean. Never thought I would be saying this about mushrooms.', 'I was diagnosed with ADHD just after I turned 20. I went all my whole feeling like something was wrong with me, no one understood me, I was a disappointment, and I didn’t understand why I struggled to understand things everyone else had no issues with, I didn’t understand why everything was so hard for me and I was getting left behind with this mental ball and chain. This video hit me so hard, especially when I was still in school. I wish people could be a little bit of understanding of simply just people who seem to struggling, not just people struggling with ADHD or other mental health stuff.

you want to let people down you wish you could do the opposite sounds like it should be so easy but no matter what you do you find yourself somewhere else entirely it's at this point that they may

Comments: ['&quot;You&#39;re exhausted. You don&#39;t know why. You didn&#39;t even get anything done today.&quot; Is my life almost every day.', 'As a teenager with severe ADD, this video perfectly described the struggles in a person’s daily life. This video portrays ADHD in a way that isn’t just the dumb “I’m so quirky because I can’t pay attention” stereotype. It shows what really happens when it goes unmediated, such as not being able to finish things you’ve started, not being able to find things that are in plain sight no matter how observant you are, and not being able to keep track of time, thinking that 2 hours were just a couple of minutes.', 'This changed my perspective of ADHD so much. I have a friend with ADHD, I don’t have it so I’ve never really understood it, whenever the teacher calls on him and he doesn’t know the answer, my teacher gives him a lecture on listening and I see him shed a tear. I thought he was lazy, never listened in class, chatty, then cries when he gets an answer wrong, I thought he was dramatic, but this really helped me learn more about ADHD, thank you for this.', 'strangely I can cope with my ADHD during school years because the schedule from the school helped me a lot to keep track of everything, was a struggle to stayed focused during class but the adrenaline to get a high score made it exciting so I got high score sometimes. But, now, as an adult. It’s getting hard to keep on with my project. Just like her, drinking water and eating, one day passed just like that. There were times where I made peace with ADHD but there were also times where I feel disappointed at myself. Living with ADHD is hard. It’s not as easy as ‘just do it’, I want to ‘just do it’ but my brain freezes then I get nauseous. Cheer up my fellow ADHRers', 'As someone who&#39;s been considering having adhd for awhile, this video really cemented it for me. The amount of times the hair on my arms raised during this because it felt like a callout specifically to me was insane, this was so beautifully and accurately written and filmed. &quot;You&#39;re exhausted. You don&#39;t know why. You didn&#39;t even get anything done today.&quot; perfectly describes my day to day life, and I severely hope to get diagnosed in the near future. Thank you for creating this', 'I&#39;m not diagnosed. I don&#39;t wanna self diagnose but I feel this video is a perfect example of how I feel. I have talked to my therapist about it. Turns out I have a sub category of ADHD called ADD. This video made me want to cry. That&#39;s exactly how I am..', '&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me about this sooner?&quot; Hits hard for me. especially when the truth is always labeled as a &quot;lame excuse, try something better next time&quot; from boss figures and teachers', 'i was diagnosed earlier this year. today i mentioned it to my dad, as i thought he knew since it&#39;d been a while. he didn&#39;t and he said a lot of surprisingly hurtful things, but mainly that he was certain i don&#39;t have adhd despite my diagnosis, and that i&#39;m just &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;without discipline&quot;. it was a very upsetting experience that&#39;s been weighing on me all day, and opening youtube and seeing this on my recommended was strangely comforting', 'I was actually diagnosed with ADHD since my teenage. I suffered severe depression and mental disorder. Not until my mom recommended me to psilocybin mushrooms treatment. Psilocybin treatment saved my life honestly. 9 years totally clean. Never thought I would be saying this about mushrooms.', 'I was diagnosed with ADHD just after I turned 20. I went all my whole feeling like something was wrong with me, no one understood me, I was a disappointment, and I didn’t understand why I struggled to understand things everyone else had no issues with, I didn’t understand why everything was so hard for me and I was getting left behind with this mental ball and chain. This video hit me so hard, especially when I was still in school. I wish people could be a little bit of understanding of simply just people who seem to struggling, not just people struggling with ADHD or other mental health stuff. More compassion needs to be shown']
