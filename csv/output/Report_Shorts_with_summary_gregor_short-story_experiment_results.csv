imbalance in the brain that causes issues with executive function memory organization Focus ADHD is a very hard thing to describe especially to those without it because every explanation just sounds like another excuse I just can't do it isn't enough even though oftentimes it is the reason ADHD is living a life knowing what the full picture is supposed to be but every time it matters you find yourself missing a piece you're sitting in a classroom the teacher is up front going into detail about a new assignment you're confused and everyone around you seems to be paying attention and you know that if you just did the same you wouldn't be confused but there's something about the room or the teacher or yourself that's getting in the way maybe it's just the way he's phrasing things you think so you turn to your friend and you say hey I don't get this are you able to help me and as your friend they say of course along with four words you'll be thinking about for a long time what don't you understand you're in your room trying to read the assignment for yourself but your thoughts wash it out if you're reading a sentence and you're reading a sentence and you're reading a sentence and you're reading a sentence and you're reading a sentence and you're reading a sentence and you're reading a sentence you should turn off the fan and pour yourself a glass of water or get something to eat you've really been meaning to stay more hydrated but you keep losing track of time I'm thirsty or I'm hungry becomes I've almost finished this task I'll get it when I'm done it becomes I've been sitting here for hours tied to my spot by the air and my own nerves and I'm feeling light-headed to be safe you pour yourself another glass of water hopefully now you'll be able to focus you walk back to your room and realize the sun has set you've wasted the day sticky notes have been known to help you keep track of what you need to do so you write a note for yourself and you go to bed you know it would be better to prepare for tomorrow tonight but it'll be fine you've got your alarm set you'll wake up with plenty of time you miss your alarms you missed your chance to pack have breakfast brush your teeth you're missing your keys and in the rush to find them you think of all the times you've been here before if only you could just learn your lesson your mum's waiting for you by the door it's been two days is it really that important yes it was in the bag but it's gone missing do you really have to find it now just leave it we're gonna be classes started people are staring you try not to stare back it's rude nice of you to join us the teacher says this is the time this month he continues with the lesson you try your hardest to focus and pay attention and take in what he's saying just listen it's not hard just listen and everything will be so much easier what is he even saying oh God this always happens can I please just listen you're on the train home you look at the next stop screen reciting each station in your head how many times have you been here how many times have you done this you've made it home you're exhausted you don't know why you didn't even get anything done today it would make sense being destroyed if you've gotten something done but your brain is fried without the results to justify it and that's when you realize you forgot to ask about the assignment whatever you'll just ask him tomorrow and why didn't you tell me sooner well I was meant to but it slipped my mind for two weeks it's been two weeks yes it's been two weeks right well um uh actually what have you been doing in class the past few weeks what have you been doing nothing absolutely nothing but you can't tell him that that'll never be enough so you find yourself making something up that convinces no one but what else can you do two weeks two valuable weeks gone wasted it's due by the end of the week and you have nothing absolutely nothing to work with no notes no Foundation you're running out of time you're running out of time you're running out of time you're running out of time you're running out of time you're running out of time you're running out of time you're running out of time you look at the sticky notes on your wall they're good at keeping track of what you've failed to do with what you haven't even tried to do all the promises you've made to friends teachers and yourself that you've broken in time it's not like you want to let people down you wish you could do the opposite sounds like it should be so easy but no matter what you do you find yourself somewhere else entirely it's at this point that they may have thought of this assignment sends you into a spiral of Despair are you just doomed to be like this forever with life of constant noise and distraction and disappointment you start to wonder how long you'll end up stretching this project out until you can finally get it done all hope seems lost you're alone and exhausted and finally a bottle a small white bottle Dex amphetamine the doctor said five milligrams twice a day it's the only thing you haven't tried so you try it and it's like putting on a pair of glasses after a lifetime of not knowing just how blind you really were it helps good ,623.0400000000001,1.630713918849512,6452,"['&quot;You&#39;re exhausted. You don&#39;t know why. You didn&#39;t even get anything done today.&quot; Is my life almost every day.', 'As a teenager with severe ADD, this video perfectly described the struggles in a person’s daily life. This video portrays ADHD in a way that isn’t just the dumb “I’m so quirky because I can’t pay attention” stereotype. It shows what really happens when it goes unmediated, such as not being able to finish things you’ve started, not being able to find things that are in plain sight no matter how observant you are, and not being able to keep track of time, thinking that 2 hours were just a couple of minutes.', 'This changed my perspective of ADHD so much. I have a friend with ADHD, I don’t have it so I’ve never really understood it, whenever the teacher calls on him and he doesn’t know the answer, my teacher gives him a lecture on listening and I see him shed a tear. I thought he was lazy, never listened in class, chatty, then cries when he gets an answer wrong, I thought he was dramatic, but this really helped me learn more about ADHD, thank you for this.', 'strangely I can cope with my ADHD during school years because the schedule from the school helped me a lot to keep track of everything, was a struggle to stayed focused during class but the adrenaline to get a high score made it exciting so I got high score sometimes. But, now, as an adult. It’s getting hard to keep on with my project. Just like her, drinking water and eating, one day passed just like that. There were times where I made peace with ADHD but there were also times where I feel disappointed at myself. Living with ADHD is hard. It’s not as easy as ‘just do it’, I want to ‘just do it’ but my brain freezes then I get nauseous. Cheer up my fellow ADHRers', 'As someone who&#39;s been considering having adhd for awhile, this video really cemented it for me. The amount of times the hair on my arms raised during this because it felt like a callout specifically to me was insane, this was so beautifully and accurately written and filmed. &quot;You&#39;re exhausted. You don&#39;t know why. You didn&#39;t even get anything done today.&quot; perfectly describes my day to day life, and I severely hope to get diagnosed in the near future. Thank you for creating this', 'I&#39;m not diagnosed. I don&#39;t wanna self diagnose but I feel this video is a perfect example of how I feel. I have talked to my therapist about it. Turns out I have a sub category of ADHD called ADD. This video made me want to cry. That&#39;s exactly how I am..', '&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me about this sooner?&quot; Hits hard for me. especially when the truth is always labeled as a &quot;lame excuse, try something better next time&quot; from boss figures and teachers', 'i was diagnosed earlier this year. today i mentioned it to my dad, as i thought he knew since it&#39;d been a while. he didn&#39;t and he said a lot of surprisingly hurtful things, but mainly that he was certain i don&#39;t have adhd despite my diagnosis, and that i&#39;m just &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;without discipline&quot;. it was a very upsetting experience that&#39;s been weighing on me all day, and opening youtube and seeing this on my recommended was strangely comforting', 'I was actually diagnosed with ADHD since my teenage. I suffered severe depression and mental disorder. Not until my mom recommended me to psilocybin mushrooms treatment. Psilocybin treatment saved my life honestly. 9 years totally clean. Never thought I would be saying this about mushrooms.', 'I was diagnosed with ADHD just after I turned 20. I went all my whole feeling like something was wrong with me, no one understood me, I was a disappointment, and I didn’t understand why I struggled to understand things everyone else had no issues with, I didn’t understand why everything was so hard for me and I was getting left behind with this mental ball and chain. This video hit me so hard, especially when I was still in school. I wish people could be a little bit of understanding of simply just people who seem to struggling, not just people struggling with ADHD or other mental health stuff.

sentence and you're reading a sentence you should turn off the fan and pour yourself a glass of water or get something to eat you've really been meaning to stay more hydrated but you keep losing track of time I'm thirsty or I'm hungry becomes I've almost finished this task I'll get it when I'm done it becomes I've been sitting here for hours tied to my spot by the air and my own nerves and I'm feeling light-headed to be safe you pour yourself another glass of water hopefully now you'll be able to focus you walk back to your room and realize the sun has set you've wasted the day sticky notes have been known to help you keep track of what you need to do so you write a note for yourself and you go to bed you know it would be better to prepare for tomorrow tonight but it'll be fine you've got your alarm set you'll wake up with plenty of time you miss your alarms you missed your chance to pack have breakfast brush your teeth you're missing your keys and in the rush to find them you think of all the times you've been here before if only you could just learn your lesson your mum's waiting for you by the door it's been two days is it really that important yes it was in the bag but it's gone missing do you really have to find it now just leave it we're gonna be classes started people are staring you try not to stare back it's rude nice of you to join us the teacher says this is the time this month he continues with the lesson you try your hardest to focus and pay attention and take in what he's saying just listen it's not hard just listen and everything will be so much easier what is he even saying oh God this always happens can I please just listen you're on the train home you look at the next stop screen reciting each station in your head how many times have you been here how many times have you done this you've made it home you're exhausted you don't know why you didn't even get anything done today it would make sense being destroyed if you've gotten something done but your brain is fried without the results to justify it and that's when you realize you forgot to ask about the assignment whatever you'll just ask him tomorrow and why didn't you tell me sooner well I was meant to but it slipped my mind for two weeks it's been two weeks yes it's been two weeks right well um uh actually what have you been doing in class the past few weeks what have you been doing nothing absolutely nothing but you can't tell him that that'll never be enough so you find yourself making something up that convinces no one but what else can you do two weeks two valuable weeks gone wasted it's due by the end of the week and you have nothing absolutely nothing to work with no notes no Foundation you're running out of time you're running out of time you're running out of time you're running out of time you're running out of time you're running out of time you're running out of time you're running out of time you look at the sticky notes on your wall they're good at keeping track of what you've failed to do with what you haven't even tried to do all the promises you've made to friends teachers and yourself that you've broken in time it's not like you want to let people down you wish you could do the opposite sounds like it should be so easy but no matter what you do you find yourself somewhere else entirely it's at this point that they may have thought of this assignment sends you into a spiral of Despair are you just doomed to be like this forever with life of constant noise and distraction and disappointment you start to wonder how long you'll end up stretching this project out until you can finally get it done all hope seems lost you're alone and exhausted and finally a bottle a small white bottle Dex amphetamine the doctor said five milligrams twice a day it's the only thing you haven't tried so you try it and it's like putting on a pair of glasses after a lifetime of not knowing just how blind you really were it helps good 
Comments: ['&quot;You&#39;re exhausted. You don&#39;t know why. You didn&#39;t even get anything done today.&quot; Is my life almost every day.', 'As a teenager with severe ADD, this video perfectly described the struggles in a person’s daily life. This video portrays ADHD in a way that isn’t just the dumb “I’m so quirky because I can’t pay attention” stereotype. It shows what really happens when it goes unmediated, such as not being able to finish things you’ve started, not being able to find things that are in plain sight no matter how observant you are, and not being able to keep track of time, thinking that 2 hours were just a couple of minutes.', 'This changed my perspective of ADHD so much. I have a friend with ADHD, I don’t have it so I’ve never really understood it, whenever the teacher calls on him and he doesn’t know the answer, my teacher gives him a lecture on listening and I see him shed a tear. I thought he was lazy, never listened in class, chatty, then cries when he gets an answer wrong, I thought he was dramatic, but this really helped me learn more about ADHD, thank you for this.', 'strangely I can cope with my ADHD during school years because the schedule from the school helped me a lot to keep track of everything, was a struggle to stayed focused during class but the adrenaline to get a high score made it exciting so I got high score sometimes. But, now, as an adult. It’s getting hard to keep on with my project. Just like her, drinking water and eating, one day passed just like that. There were times where I made peace with ADHD but there were also times where I feel disappointed at myself. Living with ADHD is hard. It’s not as easy as ‘just do it’, I want to ‘just do it’ but my brain freezes then I get nauseous. Cheer up my fellow ADHRers', 'As someone who&#39;s been considering having adhd for awhile, this video really cemented it for me. The amount of times the hair on my arms raised during this because it felt like a callout specifically to me was insane, this was so beautifully and accurately written and filmed. &quot;You&#39;re exhausted. You don&#39;t know why. You didn&#39;t even get anything done today.&quot; perfectly describes my day to day life, and I severely hope to get diagnosed in the near future. Thank you for creating this', 'I&#39;m not diagnosed. I don&#39;t wanna self diagnose but I feel this video is a perfect example of how I feel. I have talked to my therapist about it. Turns out I have a sub category of ADHD called ADD. This video made me want to cry. That&#39;s exactly how I am..', '&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me about this sooner?&quot; Hits hard for me. especially when the truth is always labeled as a &quot;lame excuse, try something better next time&quot; from boss figures and teachers', 'i was diagnosed earlier this year. today i mentioned it to my dad, as i thought he knew since it&#39;d been a while. he didn&#39;t and he said a lot of surprisingly hurtful things, but mainly that he was certain i don&#39;t have adhd despite my diagnosis, and that i&#39;m just &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;without discipline&quot;. it was a very upsetting experience that&#39;s been weighing on me all day, and opening youtube and seeing this on my recommended was strangely comforting', 'I was actually diagnosed with ADHD since my teenage. I suffered severe depression and mental disorder. Not until my mom recommended me to psilocybin mushrooms treatment. Psilocybin treatment saved my life honestly. 9 years totally clean. Never thought I would be saying this about mushrooms.', 'I was diagnosed with ADHD just after I turned 20. I went all my whole feeling like something was wrong with me, no one understood me, I was a disappointment, and I didn’t understand why I struggled to understand things everyone else had no issues with, I didn’t understand why everything was so hard for me and I was getting left behind with this mental ball and chain. This video hit me so hard, especially when I was still in school. I wish people could be a little bit of understanding of simply just people who seem to struggling, not just people struggling with ADHD or other mental health stuff. More compassion needs to be shown']
