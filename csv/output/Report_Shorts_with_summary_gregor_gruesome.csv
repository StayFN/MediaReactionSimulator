Opening shots establish immediate intimacy with the species, transitioning smoothly to close-ups exposing razor-sharp fins. Impressive handling and precise movements accentuate the risk associated with engaging such creatures. Strikingly vivid visuals combine with naturalist commentary, placing emphasis on the biological marvels of aquatic life. Curiosity drives the short film forward, instigating a sudden shift from passive to active resistance. Blood splatter adds a visceral dimension, intensifying the encounters' gritty reality. Despite minor injuries, Guga maintains composure and continues analyzing the phenomenon, preserving scientific detachment."

","         This Film & Animation YouTube entry, presented by Kaos Culture, reviews the French-Canadian horror flick ""Martyrs."" The unsettling premise opens in 1971, chronicling Lucy's escape from prolonged abuse. Fifteen years pass, and Lucy exacts revenge on seemingly innocent targets, believing them complicit in her childhood trauma. Co-protagonist Anna joins Lucy, driven by a desire to alleviate her affliction. Violence escalates, introducing grotesque manifestations and mysticism. Gruesome acts of cruelty unfurl, challenging the limits of cinematic tolerance. The review wraps with reflections on transcendental themes embedded in the film, ultimately inciting philosophical introspection."

","         Within this People & Blogs YouTube short, titled ""Swordfish is no JOKE!"" by Guga, a fisherman handles a swordfish. Upon removal from water, the fish violently thrusts its bill, narrowly missing the handler, demonstrating its defense mechanism. Surprised, Guga cautions viewers about the fish's capabilities. Continuing to inspect the fish, he slices through scales, revealing the blade-like bills underneath. Unexpectedly, the fisherman suffers a leg injury, likely caused by contact with the swordfish's rough exterior. Ignoring his bleeding leg, the fisherman proceeds to examine the fish's sharp edges. Remarks center around the fisherman's calm demeanor amidst the chaotic encounter."

","         This Film & Animation YouTube short, ""Martyrs: The Most Brutal and Tortuous Movie You'll Ever Watch"" by Kaos Culture, presents the disturbing French Canadian horror film directed by Pascal Laugier. The storyline follows Lucy, a survivor of severe childhood abuse, seeking vengeance on her assumed tormentors. Escalating violence and psychological turmoil engulf Lucy and her companion Anna. Realizations dawn, forcing Lucy to recognize that freedom from external oppressors does not erase internal demons. The climactic scenes delve into psychological dimensions of suffering and acceptance. While explicitly violent, the short provides an opportunity for exploration of heavy philosophical topics."

","         This concise Gaming YouTube short, created by StrikerBOY, explores Plague Tale. Dark ambiance prevails as the anonymous figure advances stealthily, clutching a torch and brandishing a primitive weapon. Sudden tension erupts as terrified squeals fill the speakers, accompanied by urgent string instruments. Moments later, the screen transforms into crimson chaos. Groaning, the individual lumbers toward a lifeless pig sprawled on the muddy earth. Harsh breathing dominates the final seconds, reinforcing the gloomy essence of the scene. Absent viewer responses allow immersion within the gut-wrenching environment, eliciting intrigue and apprehension."

","          This Gaming YouTube short, ""Dead Island 2 be like... (ft. Sweetie Fox)"" by Lordxlaw, centers on navigating post-zombie apocalypse Los Angeles. Gameplay incorporates humorous monologue, light-heartedly discussing mechanics and discoveries. Among them, finding Zenitsu's iconic katana, unlocking superior melee capability. Intermittent commentary touches upon commonplace frustrations, such as inconsistent door functionality. All the while, explicit material plays inconspicuously in the corner – perhaps as a distraction, possibly as comedic relief. The relaxed atmosphere suggests a friendly invitation to join the adventure."

4SoiSWjjgyY,b'Top 10 Most Satisfying Revenge Moments In Anime',b'Animan',foreign [Music] revenge stories one of the most commonly written storylines in fictional media here almost every time the story tends to lead the hero and go down a dark path blurring the line between right and wrong through actions that are pretty much questionable also one of the most traditional patterns of revenge stories are one of the so-called heroic groups being extremely narrow-minded and focusing on nothing besides their vengeful schemes and when all these come to anime it reaches a whole new level although there have been a bunch of Revenge driven anime stories only a few managed to live up to the level of giving Goosebumps to the viewer in this video we will be talking about the top 10 iconic Revenge moments in anime that have shaken the anime World down to its very core so without further delay let's begin foreign [Music] number 10 is Gabby exposed Endeavor and hero society's corruption my hero Academia in my hero Academia the extremely chaotic paranormal Liberation War caused damage not only to the heroes but also led to a social downfall it led to the Public's distrusting Heroes especially since the number one Hero's shady past of domestic abuse exposed one of the most prominent villains dabby revealed that he was Toya Todoroki The Sibling whom which everyone thought was dead after Shoto was born dabby was basically abandoned by Endeavor since the former's Quirk was deemed better than his as a result Debbie became a brutal villain and literally killed 30 people to get endeavor's attention reminding him that the past Never Dies he had been waiting for years to give revenge on Endeavor and even after exposing him on a national stage level he was not done yet he won't stop until Endeavor Shoto and the rest of the Toto rokis are dead is coming out at number nine is Spike and vicious rivalry Cowboy Bebop all right it's time to visit some vintage ones Spike and vicious were actually friends in Cowboy Bebop at one point years before the beginning of the series spike a rising member of a crime syndicate became a partner and friend of vicious another member of The Syndicate the two were like brothers but then a love triangle interfered with their friendship after being wounded in a gun battle spike is Nurse back to health by vicious girlfriend Julia and the two fall in love spike faked his own death left The Syndicate and tried to take Julia with it it was a betrayal that vicious sought to avenge with both Spike and Julia's death vicious ordered Julia to kill Spike but she went against his orders she was on the run for a while until eventually she was found and killed by The Syndicate causing both of the main characters to become Arch enemies of each other coming in number eight is maki decimated the Zen and Clan Jiu Jitsu Kaizen badass revenge is incoming here but before that be warned because manga spoilers are ahead so if you want to keep this awesome moment in the anime it probably would be better if you skipped ahead even though this is an anime list I had to include this those who had read it know what I am talking about maki's revenge against the Zenon Clan was years in the making in Jujitsu Kaizen Nike rebelled against the clan and won a Tokyo Jiu Jitsu high after suffering years of abuse for lacking her Clan's traditional cursed energy Maki proved herself a powerful sorcerer but even after that the zening plan schemed against her and stops her promotion at all costs but things drastically changed in the recent chapters of the manga Maki proved that she is on the same level as the Zenon Clan's original betrayer toji fushiguro AKA megumi's dad but the most pivotal moment in maki's story is when she returns to the Zenon clan for cursed tools after entering the warehouse to get what she needed monkey realized that Mai is bleeding out on the floor and Ogie had trapped them inside so she wasted no time and Maki first kills Ogie then Woodley wipes out the rest of the clan and then my friend is why you don't mess with badass women foreign number seven is thorfin's desire to avenge his father then Lin Saga Finland Saga is easily one of the most iconic anime series directed through Revenge norfin the main character of the show is filled with blind rage towards oscalon the guy who killed his father Thor's before witnessing his father's brutal death thorphan was a lovely kid who didn't have a single vengeful Instinct in his body he looked up to and admired his father for his entire life and even after he was killed orphan literally became a killing machine consumed with rage and desire to kill askalot with his own hands as compensation for his losses he worked with ocelot in a deal to become stronger and one day finally kill him but the Fate that awaited the main character of the show was probably one of the most surprising moments in all of anime no coming at number six is Tatsumi gets revenge on Arya akami got killed and akami got killed Tatsumi joined the night raid out of pure rage for what happened to his longtime friend Sayo she was tortured to death and this left Tatsumi wanting nothing but brutal revenge for his friend however things get seriously complicated after touching me met Arya Arya was a cute young girl and initially appeared to be very kind optimistic and caring she even invited tatsui to stay at her home but in reality she was just like her family they tortured and killed sio when the night raid attacker taught me out of pure misleading tried defending Arya however when the truth is revealed to Tatsumi about Arya and her family Tatsumi has nothing to hold back he kills her with a single and Swit Slash from his sword a truly and satisfying moment to watch no [Music] [Music] coming in number five is shikimaru proved himself a strategic genius when he got revenge on Hidan Naruto Shippuden okay time for a classic one after Hidan killed Asuma in Naruto Shippuden Shikamaru immediately got to scheming the ultimate Revenge strategy against Hidan the evil Shinobi who killed his teacher during his battle against Iran Shikamaru really proved himself as a strategic genius he used an extremely detailed plan to trap Hidan up and then finally use the shadow summoning Jutsu to cover his body in explosive tags but that wasn't the satisfying part the peak of their fight was when shikimaru laughed while getting a wider ready he then threw it at Hidan but the amazing part is that Hidan was an immortal shimnoby but yet he still exploded his dismembered body parts literally flew everywhere even after that chicken Maro wasn't done he finished he done off for good with one final exploding tag now I realize I might be just a little biased putting it this high on the list but you gotta admit it was one hell of a satisfying watch [Music] coming at number four is Lelouch Rebels and kills his parents in Code Geass who else was waiting for this one to appear I mean almost everyone must have known that this one was bound to appear on this list with Lucian Code Geass is the son of Marion and Charles Britannia the emperor and Empress of the britannian Empire after the perceived death of his mother Lelouch confronts his father on the incident surrounding his mother's death he asked why more effort wasn't done to protect her but let alone answering the emperor harshly responds by exiling and trading Lelouch and his sister to Japan as prisoners where they assume new identities and finally find out the truth about their parents the siblings learned that their mother isn't actually dead and that their parents orchestrated the sister's disabilities they also uncover their plans to initiate Ragnarok this causes Lelouch to reject his parents in their plans for world domination deciding to seek his Almighty Revenge by using his GEOS to turn the gods against them killing both Charles and Marian and then taking the throne as emperor foreign number three is Mustang wanted to avenge the people he lost when fighting Envy Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood though Maize used death in Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood happened quite early in the show it was significant nonetheless and very impactful they left an extreme blow of depression in both viewers and others characters Hearts Roy Mustang in particular was super hell-bent on avenging his friend's murderer when Envy the homunculus tried to kill him Mustang didn't need to hear anything else before lunging forward to kill him himself he interfered with Envy's transformation by sending a heat blast their way that literally boiled their eyes and set them on fire Envy tried his best returning to their human form to escape but Mustang wouldn't let them go so easily he cornered envy and burned him again again and again to a point that it was even the viewers who felt it hard to watch he definitely would have killed him if it not for his allies talking him out of it at the last second still even though Mustang didn't kill him it was a crushing defeat for Envy foreign number two afro kills Justice and Avengers his father Afro Samurai the gore plot of Afro Samurai is to hold the number one headband as it is considered to be the biggest honor a warrior can have afro's father rokutaro was number one for quite a while until his old friend Justice showed up to take the headband from him and the fight results in wokotaro's death or in simple words he kills him for the headband this lights up the fire in afro's heart and he sets on a quest for Revenge after a bunch of hardships he finally reaches his destination and in the final battle between him and justice justice and afro having an intensely close match and by the end of it afro swiftly chops Justice up thus executing his revenge the wild journey of Afro in the final showdown makes this scene one of the biggest acts of Revenge in anime history come on [Music] and number one goes to Army's revenge on Sports mechs JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Stone ocean no don't you do it control yourself this is a serious video God damn it no JoJo's references today boy now that that's all settled let's come back to our topic Ernie's story and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Stone ocean felt a little bit familiar didn't it it reminded the fans of polander's story from Stardust Crusaders they both lost their sisters and were dead set on avenging them after Sports Max killed Ernie's sister Gloria he threw her body in a gutter even after such a heinous act he only received a five-year sentence so Hermes repeatedly committed armed robbery and landed herself in prison so that she could stalk and gather information on that piece of crap after she was finally ready Ermey started off by Drowning Sports Max in a sewage pipe but exactly that wasn't enough to kill that piece of crap the fight continued and after getting rid of the zombies from his stand Hermes eventually beat Sports Max to death I don't know

,1403.2690000000005,1.494367794058017,1437,"['We all know that the BEST revenge story is redo of healer', 'I feel like 91 Days deserved a spot on this list, the way Angelo dismantles the entire Vanetti family from the inside is one of the best revenge plots I&#39;ve personally ever seen', 'One of the most satisfying revenge scenes is in Vivid Strike. A girl was bullied relentlessly simply because she was adopted. When she finally beat her tormentors, it was so great. Wish we got the scene a bit longer.', 'Shikamaru&#39;s revenge was so cold and badass, no aggression, no hurry , no desperation. Just a pure smart tactic with patience and the revenge was done so brutally. This guy was something else in Naruto / shippudden.', 'With Dabi its not as cruel as you said. Dabi was forced to Get powerful but They soon realised that he had no fire resistance meaning he would severely burn himself whenever he used fire. Thats why he was abondoned and then had an emotional breakdown about how he wanted to be recognised by his father.

Title: b'Top 10 Most Satisfying Revenge Moments In Anime'
Channel: b'Animan'
Transcript: foreign [Music] revenge stories one of the most commonly written storylines in fictional media here almost every time the story tends to lead the hero and go down a dark path blurring the line between right and wrong through actions that are pretty much questionable also one of the most traditional patterns of revenge stories are one of the so-called heroic groups being extremely narrow-minded and focusing on nothing besides their vengeful schemes and when all these come to anime it reaches a whole new level although there have been a bunch of Revenge driven anime stories only a few managed to live up to the level of giving Goosebumps to the viewer in this video we will be talking about the top 10 iconic Revenge moments in anime that have shaken the anime World down to its very core so without further delay let's begin foreign [Music] number 10 is Gabby exposed Endeavor and hero society's corruption my hero Academia in my hero Academia the extremely chaotic paranormal Liberation War caused damage not only to the heroes but also led to a social downfall it led to the Public's distrusting Heroes especially since the number one Hero's shady past of domestic abuse exposed one of the most prominent villains dabby revealed that he was Toya Todoroki The Sibling whom which everyone thought was dead after Shoto was born dabby was basically abandoned by Endeavor since the former's Quirk was deemed better than his as a result Debbie became a brutal villain and literally killed 30 people to get endeavor's attention reminding him that the past Never Dies he had been waiting for years to give revenge on Endeavor and even after exposing him on a national stage level he was not done yet he won't stop until Endeavor Shoto and the rest of the Toto rokis are dead is coming out at number nine is Spike and vicious rivalry Cowboy Bebop all right it's time to visit some vintage ones Spike and vicious were actually friends in Cowboy Bebop at one point years before the beginning of the series spike a rising member of a crime syndicate became a partner and friend of vicious another member of The Syndicate the two were like brothers but then a love triangle interfered with their friendship after being wounded in a gun battle spike is Nurse back to health by vicious girlfriend Julia and the two fall in love spike faked his own death left The Syndicate and tried to take Julia with it it was a betrayal that vicious sought to avenge with both Spike and Julia's death vicious ordered Julia to kill Spike but she went against his orders she was on the run for a while until eventually she was found and killed by The Syndicate causing both of the main characters to become Arch enemies of each other coming in number eight is maki decimated the Zen and Clan Jiu Jitsu Kaizen badass revenge is incoming here but before that be warned because manga spoilers are ahead so if you want to keep this awesome moment in the anime it probably would be better if you skipped ahead even though this is an anime list I had to include this those who had read it know what I am talking about maki's revenge against the Zenon Clan was years in the making in Jujitsu Kaizen Nike rebelled against the clan and won a Tokyo Jiu Jitsu high after suffering years of abuse for lacking her Clan's traditional cursed energy Maki proved herself a powerful sorcerer but even after that the zening plan schemed against her and stops her promotion at all costs but things drastically changed in the recent chapters of the manga Maki proved that she is on the same level as the Zenon Clan's original betrayer toji fushiguro AKA megumi's dad but the most pivotal moment in maki's story is when she returns to the Zenon clan for cursed tools after entering the warehouse to get what she needed monkey realized that Mai is bleeding out on the floor and Ogie had trapped them inside so she wasted no time and Maki first kills Ogie then Woodley wipes out the rest of the clan and then my friend is why you don't mess with badass women foreign number seven is thorfin's desire to avenge his father then Lin Saga Finland Saga is easily one of the most iconic anime series directed through Revenge norfin the main character of the show is filled with blind rage towards oscalon the guy who killed his father Thor's before witnessing his father's brutal death thorphan was a lovely kid who didn't have a single vengeful Instinct in his body he looked up to and admired his father for his entire life and even after he was killed orphan literally became a killing machine consumed with rage and desire to kill askalot with his own hands as compensation for his losses he worked with ocelot in a deal to become stronger and one day finally kill him but the Fate that awaited the main character of the show was probably one of the most surprising moments in all of anime no coming at number six is Tatsumi gets revenge on Arya akami got killed and akami got killed Tatsumi joined the night raid out of pure rage for what happened to his longtime friend Sayo she was tortured to death and this left Tatsumi wanting nothing but brutal revenge for his friend however things get seriously complicated after touching me met Arya Arya was a cute young girl and initially appeared to be very kind optimistic and caring she even invited tatsui to stay at her home but in reality she was just like her family they tortured and killed sio when the night raid attacker taught me out of pure misleading tried defending Arya however when the truth is revealed to Tatsumi about Arya and her family Tatsumi has nothing to hold back he kills her with a single and Swit Slash from his sword a truly and satisfying moment to watch no [Music] [Music] coming in number five is shikimaru proved himself a strategic genius when he got revenge on Hidan Naruto Shippuden okay time for a classic one after Hidan killed Asuma in Naruto Shippuden Shikamaru immediately got to scheming the ultimate Revenge strategy against Hidan the evil Shinobi who killed his teacher during his battle against Iran Shikamaru really proved himself as a strategic genius he used an extremely detailed plan to trap Hidan up and then finally use the shadow summoning Jutsu to cover his body in explosive tags but that wasn't the satisfying part the peak of their fight was when shikimaru laughed while getting a wider ready he then threw it at Hidan but the amazing part is that Hidan was an immortal shimnoby but yet he still exploded his dismembered body parts literally flew everywhere even after that chicken Maro wasn't done he finished he done off for good with one final exploding tag now I realize I might be just a little biased putting it this high on the list but you gotta admit it was one hell of a satisfying watch [Music] coming at number four is Lelouch Rebels and kills his parents in Code Geass who else was waiting for this one to appear I mean almost everyone must have known that this one was bound to appear on this list with Lucian Code Geass is the son of Marion and Charles Britannia the emperor and Empress of the britannian Empire after the perceived death of his mother Lelouch confronts his father on the incident surrounding his mother's death he asked why more effort wasn't done to protect her but let alone answering the emperor harshly responds by exiling and trading Lelouch and his sister to Japan as prisoners where they assume new identities and finally find out the truth about their parents the siblings learned that their mother isn't actually dead and that their parents orchestrated the sister's disabilities they also uncover their plans to initiate Ragnarok this causes Lelouch to reject his parents in their plans for world domination deciding to seek his Almighty Revenge by using his GEOS to turn the gods against them killing both Charles and Marian and then taking the throne as emperor foreign number three is Mustang wanted to avenge the people he lost when fighting Envy Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood though Maize used death in Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood happened quite early in the show it was significant nonetheless and very impactful they left an extreme blow of depression in both viewers and others characters Hearts Roy Mustang in particular was super hell-bent on avenging his friend's murderer when Envy the homunculus tried to kill him Mustang didn't need to hear anything else before lunging forward to kill him himself he interfered with Envy's transformation by sending a heat blast their way that literally boiled their eyes and set them on fire Envy tried his best returning to their human form to escape but Mustang wouldn't let them go so easily he cornered envy and burned him again again and again to a point that it was even the viewers who felt it hard to watch he definitely would have killed him if it not for his allies talking him out of it at the last second still even though Mustang didn't kill him it was a crushing defeat for Envy foreign number two afro kills Justice and Avengers his father Afro Samurai the gore plot of Afro Samurai is to hold the number one headband as it is considered to be the biggest honor a warrior can have afro's father rokutaro was number one for quite a while until his old friend Justice showed up to take the headband from him and the fight results in wokotaro's death or in simple words he kills him for the headband this lights up the fire in afro's heart and he sets on a quest for Revenge after a bunch of hardships he finally reaches his destination and in the final battle between him and justice justice and afro having an intensely close match and by the end of it afro swiftly chops Justice up thus executing his revenge the wild journey of Afro in the final showdown makes this scene one of the biggest acts of Revenge in anime history come on [Music] and number one goes to Army's revenge on Sports mechs JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Stone ocean no don't you do it control yourself this is a serious video God damn it no JoJo's references today boy now that that's all settled let's come back to our topic Ernie's story and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Stone ocean felt a little bit familiar didn't it it reminded the fans of polander's story from Stardust Crusaders they both lost their sisters and were dead set on avenging them after Sports Max killed Ernie's sister Gloria he threw her body in a gutter even after such a heinous act he only received a five-year sentence so Hermes repeatedly committed armed robbery and landed herself in prison so that she could stalk and gather information on that piece of crap after she was finally ready Ermey started off by Drowning Sports Max in a sewage pipe but exactly that wasn't enough to kill that piece of crap the fight continued and after getting rid of the zombies from his stand Hermes eventually beat Sports Max to death I don't know about you guys but seeing that that this Revenge story reached a whole

Dabi was forced to Get powerful but They soon realised that he had no fire resistance meaning he would severely burn himself whenever he used fire. Thats why he was abondoned and then had an emotional breakdown about how he wanted to be recognised by his father. Its still tragic but there is a reason on why he was told to never use his powers.', 'My favorite out of all of these is definitely Mustang.<br>We see him the whole series as this calm and collected guy (even at Hughes funeral he keeps himself from crying in front of everyone but Hawkeye).

nVT9OCQQw7w,b'The Unspeakable Things Genghis Khan Did To His Enemies',b'A Day In History',in the 13th and 14th centuries the mongols established the largest land empire in human history at its furthest extent the mongolian empire stretched from the coast of china along the northern border of the himalayas encompassing much of today's middle east from persia to the black sea much of south central russia and ukraine and europe to the gates of vienna this was done on foot wagon and most famously on horseback by the time the mongols reached the eastern borders of ukraine in the late 1200s some of their armies numbered one hundred thousand but it was not their numbers that were the mongols primary weapon terror was that policy of terror started with their first great leader the infamous genghis khan he is not infamous everywhere the great khan as he is also known is still a national hero in mongolia today if you're interested in more topics like this please like and subscribe to our channel and hit the notification button to see more brutal and unusual content khan means ruler or chieftain genghis khan means a universal ruler the mongolians ruled such a vast empire that the name is barely an exaggeration even before the ascension of genghis to the leadership of all the mongol tribes mongol society was a brutal one like the vikings on the other side of the globe the mongolians were often known for the brutal murders of their kin especially when it came to the ruling class or those who wanted to rule eliminating all other lines of one's family ensured their children would inherit their positions and power genghis's real name was tamagen which means of iron like a certain soviet leader some 700 years later temujin needed to be made of iron to survive unlike stalin temujin killed his first person at age 14 and that was his half-brother many stories about this episode have it that genghis's older half-brother better stole a fish that temujin killed for the night's meal and ate it all himself refusing to share with his family soon after temujin secretly followed better waiting for him to be alone and then shot him with one of the famous mongol recurved bows another version of the story adds that better as the oldest brother began to order people around and this caused resentment on the part of temujin and his younger full brother kassar there may or may not have been food involved but in this version temujin simply used bettar's greed as an excuse to kill him and move to take control of the clan himself this was not unexpected or unusual finding out about the death of better the boy's mother basically gave her murderous son a scolding life was hard in the time of genghis khan who lived from around 1162 to 12 15 a.d genghis did not become the khan of all the mongols until he was about 44 years old but at the age of 20 he was an up-and-coming military leader in command of his own clan army one of the first things he did with that army was to seek revenge for his father's murder you'd better get used to it there is an awful lot of murder in the life of genghis khan and the mongols temujin's father was killed by a group of tatars who have an unfortunate history they were driven west by the mongols settled in southern russia ukraine and crimea and were deported on mass by stalin for their refusal to follow his dictates to his liking hundreds of years before they got on the wrong side of another dictator genghis khan whose father had been poisoned by the tartars at a wedding eleven years later temujin cornered the main tata army and camp slaughtering many in battle and taking thousands of prisoners men women and children as collective punishment for the murder of his father yasuge genghis ordered that all people over a certain age were to be killed to illustrate what he meant he strolled over to a wagon and marked the height on a wheel three feet everyone was killed except some young children and infants yes there used to be pyramids in china they were built so to speak by the mongolians as a lesson for all who thought about opposing them the mongol pyramids were erected by order of genghis khan in 1215 and they were built outside of the city of beijing after a three-year mongol siege genghis's siege caused the people of beijing to turn to cannibalism to survive they likely wouldn't have survived anyway for genghis put tens of thousands of them to death travelers and diplomats who saw them swore they saw pyramids in the distance they were indeed pyramids of human skulls perhaps 50 feet high or more and there were many of them during genghis's life and after the mongols followed a regular pattern when approaching an enemy city they would send an offer along with a warning which essentially said surrender and you will be relatively unharmed resist and we will kill you all it's estimated that just during genghis's life and his time at the top was relatively short that between five to ten percent of the world's population was killed or died as a result of his campaigns remember the mongols traveled on horseback and their main weapons were the sword and the bow this was bloody face to face slaughter the female black widow spider eats the male after they mate in a very similar way the daughters of genghis khan played black widow to those they were married off to marriage among the ruling mongols and their allies and enemies of the steps is very similar to what you might have read about medieval europe daughters were commodities they could be married off to cement relations between allies or bring an end to war in the case of genghis's many daughters they could end a dynasty and begin another one to marry into the family of the great khan conferred prestige and power on the groom and his family usually this power and prestige was short-lived for as payment for marrying into genghis family a tribal ruler had to get rid of all his other wives it would be genghis's line that inherited the throne there could be no competition the groom was then promoted to high command in the front lines where almost all of them were killed so who would rule until her sons were old enough genghis's daughters with each death genghis empire expanded and no one was under any illusion who his daughters took their orders from the kwarazan people lived in the area north of today's iran and just south of the rlc for a time before the rise of genghis they had a powerful and advanced empire in the area what remains of their civilization shows advanced architectural and mathematical skills unfortunately for the kwara zam that's about all that's left cause you know genghis khan when the khan's armies approached the capital of kwarazam he behaved peacefully and sent a delegation to negotiate with his adversaries the kwara zam made a bad choice they beheaded the mongol diplomats fearing a ruse then they made their problem even worse if that's even possible with genghis khan at your gates the quraism then killed another group of mongols sent to find an agreement as you can probably guess this did not sit well with temujin aka genghis khan he sent an army of two hundred thousand men and they killed everyone they could find then he ordered his soldiers to destroy as in erase all the khwarazam castles farms fortresses houses and everything else the mongols missed a couple of remote mosques but for all intents and purposes the qurasm were made extinct their bones were even ground into dust when the mongols advanced again some time later he even ordered a river diverted to cover up all traces of the quarazum generally making a bad decision when dealing with the great khan was not something you survived one of those to learn that lesson the hard way and really was there any other way were the shashia people that roamed the steps near the borders of qurazan the shashia had been conquered by the mongols and genghis khan expected them to send troops to help destroy the quran which they did not soon after genghis recognized their disobedience he sent an army to deal with the shashia and every last one was killed every last one actually people wouldn't have even known of the shashia if stories of them hadn't been kept alive in the oral histories of the surrounding people so many people were killed that the shashia language was extinguished for several hundred years before historians found carved stones from a language they did not recognize after careful study they realized that the only traces left of a once flourishing culture were a few carved rocks the shashia might have gotten the final revenge however for during this battle genghis khan was thrown from his horse and died from his injuries in 1215. genghis body was taken back

Title: b'The Unspeakable Things Genghis Khan Did To His Enemies'
Channel: b'A Day In History'
Transcript: in the 13th and 14th centuries the mongols established the largest land empire in human history at its furthest extent the mongolian empire stretched from the coast of china along the northern border of the himalayas encompassing much of today's middle east from persia to the black sea much of south central russia and ukraine and europe to the gates of vienna this was done on foot wagon and most famously on horseback by the time the mongols reached the eastern borders of ukraine in the late 1200s some of their armies numbered one hundred thousand but it was not their numbers that were the mongols primary weapon terror was that policy of terror started with their first great leader the infamous genghis khan he is not infamous everywhere the great khan as he is also known is still a national hero in mongolia today if you're interested in more topics like this please like and subscribe to our channel and hit the notification button to see more brutal and unusual content khan means ruler or chieftain genghis khan means a universal ruler the mongolians ruled such a vast empire that the name is barely an exaggeration even before the ascension of genghis to the leadership of all the mongol tribes mongol society was a brutal one like the vikings on the other side of the globe the mongolians were often known for the brutal murders of their kin especially when it came to the ruling class or those who wanted to rule eliminating all other lines of one's family ensured their children would inherit their positions and power genghis's real name was tamagen which means of iron like a certain soviet leader some 700 years later temujin needed to be made of iron to survive unlike stalin temujin killed his first person at age 14 and that was his half-brother many stories about this episode have it that genghis's older half-brother better stole a fish that temujin killed for the night's meal and ate it all himself refusing to share with his family soon after temujin secretly followed better waiting for him to be alone and then shot him with one of the famous mongol recurved bows another version of the story adds that better as the oldest brother began to order people around and this caused resentment on the part of temujin and his younger full brother kassar there may or may not have been food involved but in this version temujin simply used bettar's greed as an excuse to kill him and move to take control of the clan himself this was not unexpected or unusual finding out about the death of better the boy's mother basically gave her murderous son a scolding life was hard in the time of genghis khan who lived from around 1162 to 12 15 a.d genghis did not become the khan of all the mongols until he was about 44 years old but at the age of 20 he was an up-and-coming military leader in command of his own clan army one of the first things he did with that army was to seek revenge for his father's murder you'd better get used to it there is an awful lot of murder in the life of genghis khan and the mongols temujin's father was killed by a group of tatars who have an unfortunate history they were driven west by the mongols settled in southern russia ukraine and crimea and were deported on mass by stalin for their refusal to follow his dictates to his liking hundreds of years before they got on the wrong side of another dictator genghis khan whose father had been poisoned by the tartars at a wedding eleven years later temujin cornered the main tata army and camp slaughtering many in battle and taking thousands of prisoners men women and children as collective punishment for the murder of his father yasuge genghis ordered that all people over a certain age were to be killed to illustrate what he meant he strolled over to a wagon and marked the height on a wheel three feet everyone was killed except some young children and infants yes there used to be pyramids in china they were built so to speak by the mongolians as a lesson for all who thought about opposing them the mongol pyramids were erected by order of genghis khan in 1215 and they were built outside of the city of beijing after a three-year mongol siege genghis's siege caused the people of beijing to turn to cannibalism to survive they likely wouldn't have survived anyway for genghis put tens of thousands of them to death travelers and diplomats who saw them swore they saw pyramids in the distance they were indeed pyramids of human skulls perhaps 50 feet high or more and there were many of them during genghis's life and after the mongols followed a regular pattern when approaching an enemy city they would send an offer along with a warning which essentially said surrender and you will be relatively unharmed resist and we will kill you all it's estimated that just during genghis's life and his time at the top was relatively short that between five to ten percent of the world's population was killed or died as a result of his campaigns remember the mongols traveled on horseback and their main weapons were the sword and the bow this was bloody face to face slaughter the female black widow spider eats the male after they mate in a very similar way the daughters of genghis khan played black widow to those they were married off to marriage among the ruling mongols and their allies and enemies of the steps is very similar to what you might have read about medieval europe daughters were commodities they could be married off to cement relations between allies or bring an end to war in the case of genghis's many daughters they could end a dynasty and begin another one to marry into the family of the great khan conferred prestige and power on the groom and his family usually this power and prestige was short-lived for as payment for marrying into genghis family a tribal ruler had to get rid of all his other wives it would be genghis's line that inherited the throne there could be no competition the groom was then promoted to high command in the front lines where almost all of them were killed so who would rule until her sons were old enough genghis's daughters with each death genghis empire expanded and no one was under any illusion who his daughters took their orders from the kwarazan people lived in the area north of today's iran and just south of the rlc for a time before the rise of genghis they had a powerful and advanced empire in the area what remains of their civilization shows advanced architectural and mathematical skills unfortunately for the kwara zam that's about all that's left cause you know genghis khan when the khan's armies approached the capital of kwarazam he behaved peacefully and sent a delegation to negotiate with his adversaries the kwara zam made a bad choice they beheaded the mongol diplomats fearing a ruse then they made their problem even worse if that's even possible with genghis khan at your gates the quraism then killed another group of mongols sent to find an agreement as you can probably guess this did not sit well with temujin aka genghis khan he sent an army of two hundred thousand men and they killed everyone they could find then he ordered his soldiers to destroy as in erase all the khwarazam castles farms fortresses houses and everything else the mongols missed a couple of remote mosques but for all intents and purposes the qurasm were made extinct their bones were even ground into dust when the mongols advanced again some time later he even ordered a river diverted to cover up all traces of the quarazum generally making a bad decision when dealing with the great khan was not something you survived one of those to learn that lesson the hard way and really was there any other way were the shashia people that roamed the steps near the borders of qurazan the shashia had been conquered by the mongols and genghis khan expected them to send troops to help destroy the quran which they did not soon after genghis recognized their disobedience he sent an army to deal with the shashia and every last one was killed every last one actually people wouldn't have even known of the shashia if stories of them hadn't been kept alive in the oral histories of the surrounding people so many people were killed that the shashia language was extinguished for several hundred years before historians found carved stones from a language they did not recognize after careful study they realized that the only traces left of a once flourishing culture were a few carved rocks the shashia might have gotten the final revenge however for during this battle genghis khan was thrown from his horse and died from his injuries in 1215. genghis body was taken back to his homelands to be buried he was reportedly buried with so much treasure that nations would have been interested in finding the site historians today believe that it's more likely that he was buried in a traditional simple mongol grave so no one would be tempted to desecrate the grave of the mightiest conqueror the world had ever seen what's more every man that witnessed or knew the location of the grave was also killed so no one could be sure where the grave was mongols

nVT9OCQQw7w,b'The Unspeakable Things Genghis Khan Did To His Enemies',b'A Day In History',in the 13th and 14th centuries the mongols established the largest land empire in human history at its furthest extent the mongolian empire stretched from the coast of china along the northern border of the himalayas encompassing much of today's middle east from persia to the black sea much of south central russia and ukraine and europe to the gates of vienna this was done on foot wagon and most famously on horseback by the time the mongols reached the eastern borders of ukraine in the late 1200s some of their armies numbered one hundred thousand but it was not their numbers that were the mongols primary weapon terror was that policy of terror started with their first great leader the infamous genghis khan he is not infamous everywhere the great khan as he is also known is still a national hero in mongolia today if you're interested in more topics like this please like and subscribe to our channel and hit the notification button to see more brutal and unusual content khan means ruler or chieftain genghis khan means a universal ruler the mongolians ruled such a vast empire that the name is barely an exaggeration even before the ascension of genghis to the leadership of all the mongol tribes mongol society was a brutal one like the vikings on the other side of the globe the mongolians were often known for the brutal murders of their kin especially when it came to the ruling class or those who wanted to rule eliminating all other lines of one's family ensured their children would inherit their positions and power genghis's real name was tamagen which means of iron like a certain soviet leader some 700 years later temujin needed to be made of iron to survive unlike stalin temujin killed his first person at age 14 and that was his half-brother many stories about this episode have it that genghis's older half-brother better stole a fish that temujin killed for the night's meal and ate it all himself refusing to share with his family soon after temujin secretly followed better waiting for him to be alone and then shot him with one of the famous mongol recurved bows another version of the story adds that better as the oldest brother began to order people around and this caused resentment on the part of temujin and his younger full brother kassar there may or may not have been food involved but in this version temujin simply used bettar's greed as an excuse to kill him and move to take control of the clan himself this was not unexpected or unusual finding out about the death of better the boy's mother basically gave her murderous son a scolding life was hard in the time of genghis khan who lived from around 1162 to 12 15 a.d genghis did not become the khan of all the mongols until he was about 44 years old but at the age of 20 he was an up-and-coming military leader in command of his own clan army one of the first things he did with that army was to seek revenge for his father's murder you'd better get used to it there is an awful lot of murder in the life of genghis khan and the mongols temujin's father was killed by a group of tatars who have an unfortunate history they were driven west by the mongols settled in southern russia ukraine and crimea and were deported on mass by stalin for their refusal to follow his dictates to his liking hundreds of years before they got on the wrong side of another dictator genghis khan whose father had been poisoned by the tartars at a wedding eleven years later temujin cornered the main tata army and camp slaughtering many in battle and taking thousands of prisoners men women and children as collective punishment for the murder of his father yasuge genghis ordered that all people over a certain age were to be killed to illustrate what he meant he strolled over to a wagon and marked the height on a wheel three feet everyone was killed except some young children and infants yes there used to be pyramids in china they were built so to speak by the mongolians as a lesson for all who thought about opposing them the mongol pyramids were erected by order of genghis khan in 1215 and they were built outside of the city of beijing after a three-year mongol siege genghis's siege caused the people of beijing to turn to cannibalism to survive they likely wouldn't have survived anyway for genghis put tens of thousands of them to death travelers and diplomats who saw them swore they saw pyramids in the distance they were indeed pyramids of human skulls perhaps 50 feet high or more and there were many of them during genghis's life and after the mongols followed a regular pattern when approaching an enemy city they would send an offer along with a warning which essentially said surrender and you will be relatively unharmed resist and we will kill you all it's estimated that just during genghis's life and his time at the top was relatively short that between five to ten percent of the world's population was killed or died as a result of his campaigns remember the mongols traveled on horseback and their main weapons were the sword and the bow this was bloody face to face slaughter the female black widow spider eats the male after they mate in a very similar way the daughters of genghis khan played black widow to those they were married off to marriage among the ruling mongols and their allies and enemies of the steps is very similar to what you might have read about medieval europe daughters were commodities they could be married off to cement relations between allies or bring an end to war in the case of genghis's many daughters they could end a dynasty and begin another one to marry into the family of the great khan conferred prestige and power on the groom and his family usually this power and prestige was short-lived for as payment for marrying into genghis family a tribal ruler had to get rid of all his other wives it would be genghis's line that inherited the throne there could be no competition the groom was then promoted to high command in the front lines where almost all of them were killed so who would rule until her sons were old enough genghis's daughters with each death genghis empire expanded and no one was under any illusion who his daughters took their orders from the kwarazan people lived in the area north of today's iran and just south of the rlc for a time before the rise of genghis they had a powerful and advanced empire in the area what remains of their civilization shows advanced architectural and mathematical skills unfortunately for the kwara zam that's about all that's left cause you know genghis khan when the khan's armies approached the capital of kwarazam he behaved peacefully and sent a delegation to negotiate with his adversaries the kwara zam made a bad choice they beheaded the mongol diplomats fearing a ruse then they made their problem even worse if that's even possible with genghis khan at your gates the quraism then killed another group of mongols sent to find an agreement as you can probably guess this did not sit well with temujin aka genghis khan he sent an army of two hundred thousand men and they killed everyone they could find then he ordered his soldiers to destroy as in erase all the khwarazam castles farms fortresses houses and everything else the mongols missed a couple of remote mosques but for all intents and purposes the qurasm were made extinct their bones were even ground into dust when the mongols advanced again some time later he even ordered a river diverted to cover up all traces of the quarazum generally making a bad decision when dealing with the great khan was not something you survived one of those to learn that lesson the hard way and really was there any other way were the shashia people that roamed the steps near the borders of qurazan the shashia had been conquered by the mongols and genghis khan expected them to send troops to help destroy the quran which they did not soon after genghis recognized their disobedience he sent an army to deal with the shashia and every last one was killed every last one actually people wouldn't have even known of the shashia if stories of them hadn't been kept alive in the oral histories of the surrounding people so many people were killed that the shashia language was extinguished for several hundred years before historians found carved stones from a language they did not recognize after careful study they realized that the only traces left of a once flourishing culture were a few carved rocks the shashia might have gotten the final revenge however for during this battle genghis khan was thrown from his horse and died from his injuries in 1215. genghis body was taken back to his homelands to be buried he was reportedly buried with so much treasure that nations would have been interested in finding the site historians today believe that it's more likely that he was buried in a traditional simple mongol grave so no one would be tempted to desecrate the grave of the mightiest conqueror the world had ever seen what's more every man that witnessed or knew the location of the grave was also killed so no one could be sure where the grave was mongols have a belief that someday the khan of khans will rise again and lead them to greatness if the grave remains

","              Insects and Plants' YouTube short, ""Elephant Explosion,"" demonstrates risks connected to handling deceased elephants. Set in India, park rangers managing a decaying elephant experienced a gas build-up, ultimately igniting an explosion comparable to a landmine. Musical overlays accentuate the revelatory tone, contrasting eeriness with morbid humor. Remarks span from advice against nearness to expired pachyderms to comparisons with whale fatalities. The clip succeeds in educating audiences on less-known biological hazards while providing entertainment value."

irYvipsIJYQ,"b'The Unspeakable Things That Happened At The ""Nanking"" Event'",b'A Day In History',on November 9 2004 39 year old best-selling historian Iris Chang committed suicide she left three separate suicide notes each different from the other but none spelling out exactly why she was taking her own life one of the notes included broad swipes at the CIA and other unnamed organizations that she claimed were persecuting her for some reason people who knew her believed those ideas to have been side effects of the powerful medicines she was taking after severe bout of depression combined with bipolar disorder those same people also think that her suicide was brought on by the stress of her busy life and probably most of all by the subjects of her books specifically one book the rape of Nan King which was published in 1997. Chang's first book thread of the silkworm 1996 was about a Chinese scientist who had been accused of being a communist spy while she worked on the famous Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb in World War II this man was eventually deported back to China in the early 1950s despite most of his American colleagues vouching for his anti-communism her third book was the Chinese in America a narrative history 2003 which among other things detailed the extreme prejudice encountered by both Chinese immigrants and those born in America at the time of her death Chang was working on her fourth book this one about the horrific Slaughter of American and Filipino troops during the infamous Bataan Death March in 1942 all of Miss Chang's Works delved into some of the very darkest places of the human soul but it was her second book the rape of Nan King that brought her both notoriety and exposure to some of the most nightmarish things that human beings can do to each other her many interviews were survivors of the Nanking atrocity haunted her for years before we dive into today's video we want to take a quick second to dive into today's sponsor g2a.com g2a is one of the biggest

something valuable from watching today please like And subscribe so we can continue bringing you important historical content before we continue we know that today the city of Nanking is referred to and known throughout the world as Nanjing but what happened in the central Chinese City made such an indelible mark on both history and the psyches of many people of the time and since that it has always been known at least in the English-speaking world as the rape of Nan King and that is how we'll refer to it as well from 1603 to 1854 Japan was a closed country no one could leave the country and foreigners were limited to a small Port near Hiroshima so when the American naval officer Matthew C Perry forced Japan to open to trade and diplomacy with the outside world the country was 200 years behind the rest of the world economically technologically and militarily over the next 40 to 50 years however Japan transformed itself from a feudal society governed by an outdated warrior class to a regional power in 1896 the Japanese defeated China in the first sino-japanese war over influence in Korea Japan also won the island of Taiwan and several other concessions in Chinese cities which essentially put the Japanese in control of small parts of China however Japan was not alone in this by 1900 China was a weak corrupt and divided power and along with the English French Germans Russians and Americans all had areas of China that were if not under their direct control were heavily influenced by them in 1904 to 1905 Japan won a stunning victory over the Russian Empire this war too was over influencing Korea which also bordered Russia with this Victory Japan gained control of Korea and took over Russian interests in northern China in the 1920s and 30s many internal and external factors led to the Japanese military's increased power over its civilian government moreover by the second half of the 1930s the Japanese military government had established almost total control over the government the economy and Japanese Society added to that was the idea that the Japanese culture and people were Superior to all others especially to China and the Chinese with which Japan had a love-hate relationship for centuries in 1931 the Japanese Army provoked an incident in Manchuria today a part of China but then a sort of an autonomous territory governed by Chinese military Warlords this was what we now call a false flag operation which ostensibly gave the Japanese an excuse to invade and take over resource Rich Manchuria in 1937 the Japanese again provoked an incident with the Chinese except that this one led to the full-scale invasion of China itself within a short time the Japanese drove South along the Chinese Coast capturing important cities and establishing control of a large part of coastal China and its hundreds of millions of inhabitants from August to October 1937 stiffening Chinese resistance in the vital Port City of Shanghai resulted in a battle sometimes referred to by historians as Stalingrad on the Yangtze River the Japanese won the battle but the stubborn resistance of the Chinese and a high number of Japanese casualties contributed to the Japanese hatred for China and its people the next Japanese Target was Nan King then the capital of China as you listen to what we're about to tell you remember that in 1937 China outside of the main cities and even within them to a large degree was governed by a notoriously corrupt fractured and inefficient government nominally ruled over by generalissimo Chang Kai-shek though Chang's kuomintang or nationalist government controlled most of the cities in China especially in the west much of the rest of the country was ruled either by the Communists under Mao Zedong or an assortment of Warlords who ran large parts of the country as their personal Empire we say this because there has been much debate in China Japan and the rest of the world about the number of people in Nanking before the Japanese arrived and the number that remained after the atrocities that were about to begin ceased census taking in China was almost non-existent then in many reports about population were wrong because people avoided being counted that could be used for tax and other purposes files that did exist were irregularly kept and updated additionally many people who lived in Nanking before the war fled as the Japanese approached and others refugees fleeing the enemy moved into the city for safety a large number of Chinese soldiers retreating from the Japanese advance to set up the city's defense also increased the population of Nan King estimates of the population of Nanking before the Japanese arrived range from about two hundred thousand to a half a million or more the publicly stated Japanese policy in China was called the burn to Ash policy or the more well-known three ores policy the three ores were kill or bernor lutol again this was the openly stated name of the Japanese policy in China the battle for the city and the surrounding area began on December 1st 1937. when Japanese troops arrived in the capital on December 13 1937 they immediately engaged the exhausted remnants of the Chinese forces within the city and drove most of them out within a day or two the Chinese Army was tired demoralized and Afraid and in their haste to flee the Japanese some Chinese units fired on each other to clear the roads and get ahead of the others to get away for it was known by almost every Chinese soldier that falling alive into Japanese hands was a fate worse than death the Japanese almost immediately began a spree of killing torture and rape that went on for six weeks among the many atrocities were Japanese officers who challenged each other to see who could behead the most Chinese in a certain amount of time with their samurai swords Chinese soldiers and civilians including the elderly infirm women and children were coraled into different areas of the city and under the eye of machine Gunners who cut down anyone trying to flee began to Lop the heads off of their victims enlisted Japanese soldiers then stacked them into Grizzly piles which were left to rot other soldiers and officers used their bayonets spearing as many Chinese as possible making things worse if that's possible was the fact that the Japanese drank themselves stupid before during and after these incidents many times locals in different areas of the city knew that the best time to try to escape was by judging how drunk the Japanese were for many of them passed out for a time in the evening only to wake up the next day and begin again the use is the Japanese found for their long bayonets defy imagination we are telling you this because it happened and should not be forgotten some of the victims of Japanese bayonets were pregnant women some were babies tossed in the air and caught on the weapon even more grisly contests were held involving enlisted men since only officers could carry swords another episode of torture involved about 200 men women and children and took place inside a school this torture involved using long needles with handles not ice picks and not MediCal needles somewhere in between that were inserted into eyes mouths navels and genitals Chinese civilians were crucified on trees phone poles and walls people had their eyes gouged out and noses cut off before having gasoline poured over them and set a fire thousands more were thrown into ditches filled with kerosene and gas satellite tanks and truck drivers also had contests seeing how many Chinese they could run over at once Japanese soldiers bound groups of Chinese together along a bridge on the Yangtze River and pushed them into the river below it went on and on and on and on for six weeks Iris Chang was criticized not her accounts of the atrocities many of which were known especially within China the Japanese acted with great brutality on many occasions throughout the war everywhere they went no the criticism of Miss Chang's book was that she was thought to have overestimated the number of dead which did not include those tortured or who survived their sexual assault Chang's estimate ran towards 1 million most people believe this is too high but the consensus is that one hundred thousand and 250 000 people were killed the only people who denied the entirety of Chang's book were and are extreme Japanese nationalists who in their delusion portray the Japanese as a victim of the West and the Chinese we call the atrocity that occurred At Nanking what we call it because that is precisely what happened tens of thousands of Chinese women and girls were raped some of the victims were 70 years old and even older some were as young as six and seven pregnant women were assaulted many of those who weren't murdered miscarried many of the women who survived became pregnant many killed themselves rather than give birth to the child of the man who assaulted them some of these assaults were carried out by individual soldiers others by groups of them some women and girls were raped repeatedly other victims were killed immediately after and even during their assault so you now know why we warned you at the beginning of this video much about the Nanking massacre is hard to believe because it was so absolutely horrific fortunately for some of those in Nanking another hard to believe story saved their lives John Raba a German trade official and Nazi party member remained in the city to help other Europeans remain safe from the Battle of non-king and the atrocities afterward at the time Germany and Japan were not allies as a matter of fact the Germans had sold supplies to the Chinese military for years but relations between the countries were getting closer in 1937 and would lead to an alliance in 1940. the Japanese did not want to alienate Hitler by violating German property during their Invasion within a short time rabba and his staff were admitting Chinese citizens into his diplomatic safe Zone what's more they were venturing into the City and issuing diplomatic safe conduct passes to anyone they could find Raba is credited with saving thousands if not tens of thousands of people after the war robber was arrested by the British as a high Nazi party member and a possible war criminal his family fell on hard times even after his release the people in government of Nanjing sent food parcels and other supplies to his family until the Chinese Civil War began in 1949. rabba's gravestone was moved from Germany to Nan King

Japan had a love-hate relationship for centuries in 1931 the Japanese Army provoked an incident in Manchuria today a part of China but then a sort of an autonomous territory governed by Chinese military Warlords this was what we now call a false flag operation which ostensibly gave the Japanese an excuse to invade and take over resource Rich Manchuria in 1937 the Japanese again provoked an incident with the Chinese except that this one led to the full-scale invasion of China itself within a short time the Japanese drove South along the Chinese Coast capturing important cities and establishing control of a large part of coastal China and its hundreds of millions of inhabitants from August to October 1937 stiffening Chinese resistance in the vital Port City of Shanghai resulted in a battle sometimes referred to by historians as Stalingrad on the Yangtze River the Japanese won the battle but the stubborn resistance of the Chinese and a high number of Japanese casualties contributed to the Japanese hatred for China and its people the next Japanese Target was Nan King then the capital of China as you listen to what we're about to tell you remember that in 1937 China outside of the main cities and even within them to a large degree was governed by a notoriously corrupt fractured and inefficient government nominally ruled over by generalissimo Chang Kai-shek though Chang's kuomintang or nationalist government controlled most of the cities in China especially in the west much of the rest of the country was ruled either by the Communists under Mao Zedong or an assortment of Warlords who ran large parts of the country as their personal Empire we say this because there has been much debate in China Japan and the rest of the world about the number of people in Nanking before the Japanese arrived and the number that remained after the atrocities that were about to begin ceased census taking in China was almost non-existent then in many reports about population were wrong because people avoided being counted that could be used for tax and other purposes files that did exist were irregularly kept and updated additionally many people who lived in Nanking before the war fled as the Japanese approached and others refugees fleeing the enemy moved into the city for safety a large number of Chinese soldiers retreating from the Japanese advance to set up the city's defense also increased the population of Nan King estimates of the population of Nanking before the Japanese arrived range from about two hundred thousand to a half a million or more the publicly stated Japanese policy in China was called the burn to Ash policy or the more well-known three ores policy the three ores were kill or bernor lutol again this was the openly stated name of the Japanese policy in China the battle for the city and the surrounding area began on December 1st 1937. when Japanese troops arrived in the capital on December 13 1937 they immediately engaged the exhausted remnants of the Chinese forces within the city and drove most of them out within a day or two the Chinese Army was tired demoralized and Afraid and in their haste to flee the Japanese some Chinese units fired on each other to clear the roads and get ahead of the others to get away for it was known by almost every Chinese soldier that falling alive into Japanese hands was a fate worse than death the Japanese almost immediately began a spree of killing torture and rape that went on for six weeks among the many atrocities were Japanese officers who challenged each other to see who could behead the most Chinese in a certain amount of time with their samurai swords Chinese soldiers and civilians including the elderly infirm women and children were coraled into different areas of the city and under the eye of machine Gunners who cut down anyone trying to flee began to Lop the heads off of their victims enlisted Japanese soldiers then stacked them into Grizzly piles which were left to rot other soldiers and officers used their bayonets spearing as many Chinese as possible making things worse if that's possible was the fact that the Japanese drank themselves stupid before during and after these incidents many times locals in different areas of the city knew that the best time to try to escape was by judging how drunk the Japanese were for many of them passed out for a time in the evening only to wake up the next day and begin again the use is the Japanese found for their long bayonets defy imagination we are telling you this because it happened and should not be forgotten some of the victims of Japanese bayonets were pregnant women some were babies tossed in the air and caught on the weapon even more grisly contests were held involving enlisted men since only officers could carry swords another episode of torture involved about 200 men women and children and took place inside a school this torture involved using long needles with handles not ice picks and not MediCal needles somewhere in between that were inserted into eyes mouths navels and genitals Chinese civilians were crucified on trees phone poles and walls people had their eyes gouged out and noses cut off before having gasoline poured over them and set a fire thousands more were thrown into ditches filled with kerosene and gas satellite tanks and truck drivers also had contests seeing how many Chinese they could run over at once Japanese soldiers bound groups of Chinese together along a bridge on the Yangtze River and pushed them into the river below it went on and on and on and on for six weeks Iris Chang was criticized not her accounts of the atrocities many of which were known especially within China the Japanese acted with great brutality on many occasions throughout the war everywhere they went no the criticism of Miss Chang's book was that she was thought to have overestimated the number of dead which did not include those tortured or who survived their sexual assault Chang's estimate ran towards 1 million most people believe this is too high but the consensus is that one hundred thousand and 250 000 people were killed the only people who denied the entirety of Chang's book were and are extreme Japanese nationalists who in their delusion portray the Japanese as a victim of the West and the Chinese we call the atrocity that occurred At Nanking what we call it because that is precisely what happened tens of thousands of Chinese women and girls were raped some of the victims were 70 years old and even older some were as young as six and seven pregnant women were assaulted many of those who weren't murdered miscarried many of the women who survived became pregnant many killed themselves rather than give birth to the child of the man who assaulted them some of these assaults were carried out by individual soldiers others by groups of them some women and girls were raped repeatedly other victims were killed immediately after and even during their assault so you now know why we warned you at the beginning of this video much about the Nanking massacre is hard to believe because it was so absolutely horrific fortunately for some of those in Nanking another hard to believe story saved their lives John Raba a German trade official and Nazi party member remained in the city to help other Europeans remain safe from the Battle of non-king and the atrocities afterward at the time Germany and Japan were not allies as a matter of fact the Germans had sold supplies to the Chinese military for years but relations between the countries were getting closer in 1937 and would lead to an alliance in 1940. the Japanese did not want to alienate Hitler by violating German property during their Invasion within a short time rabba and his staff were admitting Chinese citizens into his diplomatic safe Zone what's more they were venturing into the City and issuing diplomatic safe conduct passes to anyone they could find Raba is credited with saving thousands if not tens of thousands of people after the war robber was arrested by the British as a high Nazi party member and a possible war criminal his family fell on hard times even after his release the people in government of Nanjing sent food parcels and other supplies to his family until the Chinese Civil War began in 1949. rabba's gravestone was moved from Germany to Nan King

Abbott pulls out a knife a Tank Abbott was one of the most interesting characters they debuted during the final years of WCW Abbott was a legitimate MMA fighter and head writer for WCW Vince Russo saw duller signs the moment he saw him Russo would even pitch an idea which would see Abbott win the WCW title but thankfully this never materialized Abbott had some rather Infamous moments during his stint in the company but one particular segment stands out for all the wrong reasons the Super Bowl pay-per-view in 2000 featured the aforementioned Abbott taking on a wrestler known as Big Al this wouldn't be a standard match as it was WCW in the year 2000 meaning the match ended up being a leather jacket on a pole match Abbott would win the match but a terrifying incident would ensue shortly after Albert will proceed to pull out a knife and place it to Big Al's throat informing everyone that he could kill him WCW quickly panned away from the commotion and WCW commentators tried to logically explain what had happened but even they were completely baffled this was an unplanned spot and it was a miracle that somebody wasn't seriously hurt number nine Oklahoma has there been some tasteless wrestling parodies over the years but the parody of Jim Ross that WCW presented in 2000 went too far the character would be known as Oklahoma and was portrayed by former WWE writer Ed Ferrara Ferrara would dress in a manner similar to Jr but he would mock Jr's Bell's Palsy which was where the majority of the criticism from the character came WCW devoted so much time to this outrageous character that Oklahoma would even win the cruiserweight title which speaks volume in relation to how little WCW valued the title during the final years of the company the character quite rightly angered fans as well as people in the wrestling industry Jr was beloved respected and admired and to mock him in this manner simply wasn't going to go under the radar Jim cornette would even challenge for our top fist fight and he was so outraged at wcw's mockery of arguably wrestling's greatest commentator number eight the blood botch a 2000 was a pivotal year for wcw's a promotion is everything they've tried to do to remain relevant and popular seemed to completely flop a great example of this was during the view between former WCW world champion Kevin Nash and the new blood stable during an episode of WCW Thunder Nash will be standing in the ring and a planned spot was to see a bucket of blood falling on his head however this would ultimately fail as blood completely missed Nash making the stable look completely incompetent Nash virtually no solder botch which was probably the smartest move but just a few weeks later a similar incident would occur as Nash was about to perform a jackknife powerbomb on Vince Russo on the outside of the Ring blood would fall from the ceiling once again and it somehow missed Nash for the second time it was a total disaster and borderline laughable number 7 Judy Bagwell on a forklift events Russo was obsessed with placing various items on poles during his time in WCW from leather jackets to Viagra but in the year 2000 he developed this concept even further when he decided to have a Judy Bagwell on a forklift match the stipulation alone was enough to make fans realize that WCW was dead there was no going back but the execution of said match was beyond belief the match will be between Canyon and Buff Bagwell and if Kenyan won Judy would be his new valet whilst if Bagwell won Judy would be free and wouldn't have to worry about any torment from the villainous Canyon the match began with Kenyan driving to the ring with Judy strapped to a full clip this is when Kenyan cut a promo and declared everybody knows that this match is supposed to be a Judy Bagwell on a poll match but I searched this entire second-rate country at Canada but after searching this entire God forsaken country I couldn't find a pole that would hold that big fat battle ax the match was terrible and even featured a running from David Arquette Bagwell would win the match and he would safely be reunited with his mother who was dramatically lowered down to the ground number six Goldberg's car window incident a WCW was often compared to the Wild West in the sense that Talent did whatever they liked with no repercussions during the final years of the company wrestlers going off script was common and there was nobody with any true sense of authority to make them fall in line one of the wrestlers who WCW management struggled to reign in was Goldberg who in late 1999 went off script and almost bled to death as a result on an episode of WCW Thunder Goldberg would attack a limo with a metal pipe that went off script and smashed a window with his own hand the glass cut and archery in his arm and he was forced to go to hospital immediately this should have never happened and whilst nobody is truly to blame other than Goldberg himself WCW management should have had a better control over their talent this situation was a clear sign that inmates were running the Asylum number five Goldberg turns heel of speaking at Goldberg during the late 90s Goldberg's popularity skyrocketed their approach of bucking Goldberg in squash matches worked wonders as Goldberg gradually became the most popular baby face in all of WCW unfortunately things would begin to fall apart when they made the questionable decision to have Kevin Ash and the Goldbergs 173 in a win streak despite this the crowd remained Pro Goldberg this is until Vince Russo implemented the DraStic and damaging decision in 2000 to turn him heel Goldberg with 10 heal at the Great American bash pay-per-view turning on nation's siding with Russo and his new blood stable to say this hill term flopped hard would be an understatement Goldberg looked uncomfortable in the role and fans hated it it completely killed the Mystique of the former world champion and Russo would ultimately take no responsibility for the failed heel 10 claiming on sportskid as a legion of raw that Goldberg's heart wasn't in it number four David Arquette wins the WCW World title and the world title should be the most respected and prestigious title in a pro wrestling company but in 2000 WCW completely killed any ounce of credibility the big gold belt had prominent actor David Arquette would take part in a tag team match which pitted him in world champion DDP against Jeff Jarrett and Eric Bischoff the stipulation stated that whoever obtained the pimple would win the title naturally our cat won the match and became World Champion by pinning Bishop in one of the most shocking moments in wrestling history the decision was blasted by fans and our cat still gets ridiculed and blasted for it to this very day Bruce still likes to justify his decision to Crown our cat as a champion but made a total mockery out of WCW and their once celebrated Championship number three Vince Russo wins the WCW well title unfortunately David Arquette winning the title wasn't the only time the title became worthless in September 2000 Vince Russo decided to make himself the new WCW world champion that's right the guy who was writing the WCW product decided to make himself the world champion Russo would take on Booker T for the title inside a steel cage on Nitro the match would be heavily overbooked and featured numerous run-ins from Top Talent the finish of the match came when Goldberg speared Russo through the cage resulting in Russo winning the match and being crowned the new WCW world champion days later on Thunder Russo would announce that he was vacating the title as he was an arrestor rendering the entire title change completely pointless number two the finger poke of Doom for the January 4th 1999 episode of WCW Nitro looks set to be a fantastic show they had promised a starcade 98 rematch between Kevin Nash and Goldberg but halfway through the show Goldberg was arrested taking him out of the main event Hulk Hogan had made his Grand return to WCW as Goldberg's high profile replacement the main event match between Hogan and Ash lasted just 30 seconds after some stalling Hogan would poke Nash in the chest then proceeded to pin the world champion to once again become the top guy in WCW Hogan and Ash would then celebrate as an NWO and NWA wolf pack would reunite this was a historic moment for all the wrong reasons as wrestling fans had completely lost faith in WCW following this stunt the January 4th edition

Hulk Hogan take on Jeff Jarrett for the title as prizes the event backstage issues between Hogan and Vince Russo ensued predominantly due to Hogan wanting to win the title ultimately Russo decided to have Jarrett lay down for Hogan allowing Hogan to win the match this was completely planned and was going to lead to a storyline where fans became fully aware of Hogan's contractual backstage power

","                ""[REDACTED] Pig Happy Movie Parody,"" uploaded by ""The world is ending and I'm late for work,"" interprets an animated children's program scene, introducing darkness and maturity. Initially presenting innocuous nursery rhyme activity, the atmosphere shifts abruptly as parental absence becomes permanent. Somber piano melodies accompany melancholic monologues, counterbalanced by absurd requests for assistance. Gradually, gloomy acceptance seeps in, embracing loss and transformation. Disturbingly altered visual components generate apprehension, reinforcing the uncanny ambiance. Resultantly, the edited output deviates substantially from the source material, creating a uniquely distressing viewing experience."

","              Gore Displayer's YouTube short, ""6 minutes of brutal anime gore (13),"" compiles animated snippets containing intense bodily harm. Exhibiting accelerated sequences without context, the compilation appeals to viewers seeking explicit material. Primarily characterized by profusions of blood, the video occasionally incorporates organ damage, severed appendages, and dismemberment. Limited narrative development underscores the importance of concise editing, favoring immediate impact and visceral reaction. Predominantly silent, the soundscape consists largely of ambient noise, interrupted sporadically by audience cheers or musical segues. Counter to the title's claim, the duration falls shy of six minutes, offering a succinct compilation."

"," JustAli's YouTube short, ""The worst book I bought because of BookTok,"" scrutinizes Colleen Hoover's novel, addressing polarizing responses from readers. Ali reads excerpts, questioning the romanticization of volatile relationships, centering on an arsonist protagonist. Initial skepticism yields incredulous commentary as troubling themes unfold. Comparisons to Wattpad literature suggest parallel trajectories, drawing analogies between authors and platforms. Criticism extends beyond the text, targeting marketing tactics and labelling discrepancies. Selected quotes spark controversy, provoking divisive feedback, thereby sustaining ongoing debate. Through satire, Ali encapsulates reader concerns, voicing dissatisfaction within the expansive community of BookTok participants."

"," Mr. Klaus Heisler's YouTube short, ""Brian hate, Chase & Kill squirrels - Funny Clips/Scene moments,"" exhibits a humorous Family Guy sequence wherein pet dog Brian hunts down a squirrel infiltrating his yard. Dialogue ranges from stern warnings to playful taunts, escalating into violence. Character expressions convey conflicting emotions, blurring sympathies. Suspenseful background music belies the comic undertone, concluding with triumphant brass instrumentals and lyrics glorifying Los Angeles. Commenters focus on anthropomorphized behaviors, cognitive dissonance, and creator bias against squirrels. Speculations propose Seth MacFarlane harbors genuine distaste for rodents, given recurrent negative depictions."

"," Professional Hunting's YouTube short, ""One of the finest clips of African buffalo hunting,"" features educational commentary on the majestic creature. Displaying impressive adaptability, African buffalo thrive in various habitats ranging from densely wooded regions to sprawling grasslands. Prominent physical differences distinguish mature males and females, manifesting in musculature and distinctive horn shapes. Horn growth patterns enable age estimation, requiring approximately four years for females and five years for males to achieve full development.

","  Kween Tiwalope's YouTube short, ""How To Kill Chicken / Woman Killing Chicken,"" guides viewers through the preparation of harvesting poultry. Commencing with ritualistic cleansing and prayer, the procedure involves securing the bird, severing the jugular vein, and draining excess fluids. Demonstrating minimal efficiency, the technique prolongs the animal's suffering, eliciting condemnation from concerned spectators. Observational critique recommends sharper knives and expedited cuts, minimizing trauma. Perception varies widely, dividing audiences between culinary practice advocates and compassionate critics. Debatable ethics aside, the tutorial underscores practical techniques applicable to agricultural communities worldwide."

gsZHJMl7olI,"b'Brutal Hunting Moments By Chimpanzees, Baboons And Macaques'",b'The Fanatic',chimps are extremely strong and baboons can become incredibly abrasive both are territorial and have a hierarchical system in place have you ever seen battles between chimps what about baboons taking on chimps if you want to immerse yourself in the amazing world of chimps and baboons keep watching as we look at brutal hunting moments by chimpanzees baboons and macaques number 15 chimp versus duck in chester zoo a mother duck under 12 ducklings water into the chimpanzee enclosure the chimpanzees go crazy throwing fits at least one chimpanzee attacked another for killing a duckling and threw the mother duck into the air while other ducklings were grabbed and most likely squashed number 14 chimps kill squirrel a squirrel is chased by four chimpanzees at the san francisco zoo for a while they play around with it after that one of the chimps barely bends over bites and kills it then again he hasn't finished either he holds the squirrel up to the crowd and shows it off i guess he figures he might as well put on a good show for humans if he's going to be their source of entertainment at the oregon zoo this poor squirrel is being tossed by this chimp as everywhere a pizza being flipped in a restaurant the squirrel is flattened and killed in no time number chimp vs chimp a power struggle is going on between these chimps as some of them try to impose their rules the chimps chase and harass one another and it's not clear what's going on except for the fact there's a lot of confusion and commotion according to research this chimp's death was not a surprise the gympie was slain was the former leader of the senegalese savannah colony he was the alpha for two years before being overtaken by younger males and spending five years in exile he had tried for years to rejoin the group but was slain in the process members of his previous gang can be seen groping biting and assaulting the body in this photo at one point a member of the group attempts to wake up the dead chimp by moving its body researchers who have been studying the group for almost a decade bury the body after observing their behavior chimpanzee homicides within one social group are known to happen but there have only been a few hundred documented cases this alpha male is attacked by members of its group as they gang up on him the chimp has his back turn to them most of the time and is the victim of numerous attacks this adult chimp has snatched a baby chimp and has climbed the tree and is beating the poor baby chimp other chimps are trying to prevent it from doing so but the chimp pushes them around i guess he's the new dominant male and is killing the previous dominant male's offspring these chimps are picking on one of their own and they're not going at it lightly they're violent and relentless i don't know what this chimp did but he isn't welcome around this group number 12 chimps attack raccoon zoos demonstrate both the beauty and cruelty of the animal kingdom raccoon became trapped in the chimp cage at the saint louis zoo and was unable to escape the chimps were harassing the intruder throwing it around and sending it flying initially the chimps around and pursued the defenseless raccoon as it attempted to flee the raccoon dashed across a large boulder narrowly avoiding the grasp of the primates one monkey on the other hand grabbed its tail and threw it across the enclosure another chimp caught the raccoon by the tail as it attempted to flee through a drainpipe someone speculated the raccoon's head got stuck in the drainpipe it is possible that this is how it got in another chimp began punching the raccoon when it was defenseless what a shame allow it to leave allow it to pass some people found the racoon fight amusing i'm not sure if that was intended to be humorous because seeing a living creature in distress even if it's a pest like a raccoon is never enjoyable raccoons are notorious for sticking their noses where they don't belong with the following results the chimps gave the raccoon a piece of their mind because it had not been invited to their enclosure number 11 chimp attack humans this chimp goes bananas and attacks this man you can hear the chimp yellow set of these afternoon while its handler is trying to take control of the situation chimps are extremely strong the handler finally manages to get the situation under control all that chimp wanted was a small cup of hagen dot's ice cream a chimpanzee escaped from its enclosure in hi-fi wildlife park in east china and was captured by police a group of visitors can be seen running through the park's gates as the escaped chimpanzees pursue them observe the chimpanzees attack on this man and you'll get an idea of just how powerful a chimpanzee is this is an incredible display of strength and power and it kicks the man onto the floor without even trying too hard number 10 chimps attack monkey our thumbnail shows a chimp biting into the arm of this dead monkey the chimp has already torn the arm open and is chewing on the muscles and tendons these chimps are on the lookout for the callabas monkey one of their favorite foods the male columbus attempts to scare the chimps away even though he isn't much bigger than they are he fearlessly continues and shouts out to the rest of the team reinforcements arrive and they intend to complete the task the whole family gets involved in the hunts the catch is excellent and there is plenty of meat to go around a community-wide hunt like this brings members of the family closer together there is a lot of action hype in the trees as this chimp is looking for food the little monkeys panic and for good reason when a chimp snatches one of them up gyms have sharp teeth but to kill prey chimps hit their prey with lethal force against a hard surface they are extremely strong so a small monkey like the one in this video has no chance of surviving it's incredible to see how aggressive chimps can be you can see this chimp digging into this dead monkey chimps are not the friendly vegetarians we were told they were they do eat a diet mostly made up of fruits but it's obvious they are omnivores and will eat other animals number nine chimp versus baboon this chimp has discovered several juvenile baboons with whom to play this level of closeness complete with teasing and laughter is quite rare in the wild between such dissimilar creatures the chimp's mother isn't overprotective but she does keep an eye on her child in case he gets into mischief which he appears determined to do so he's chosen a huge monkey who refuses to participate in the game that is sufficient for the mother he calls her oldest who is tormenting the giant baboon after picking up her youngest the mother scares the baboon away with a well-aimed rock the angry baboon reappears a few minutes later and assaults a young mother the baboon undoubtably detects this female lacks the confidence of the other mother and continues to torment her she finally succeeds in chasing the monkey away a baboon is harassing these two chimps and one of them seeks protection from the other even when the baboon is attacked by the stronger chimp the baboon attacks the weaker chimp finally the stronger chimp chases the baboon away for good in this area baboons outnumber chimps by a factor of four the two species coexist peacefully for the most part but the baboon is a competitor for food so conflict can arise even a young chimp can intimidate a full-grown baboon because he has the intelligence to use a weapon the bluff works but the attacks can be very real at times the group of chimps has captured and killed a young baboon they'll gorge themselves on its remains chimps are not the gentle vegetarians that scientists thought they were but they are a formidable predator sometimes cooperating to hunt and stock their prey just like humans number eight chimp attack leopard experiments these researchers planted a fake leopard where this group of chimps could see its the leopard even moves and when the chimps see it they pick up branches and hit the leopard with rage they are so aggressive with it it's insane but one of the chimps approaches the leopard and smells it and after it senses it's fake it dismantles it and plays with its head this is one smart chimp number seven japanese macaque these monkeys attack this monkey without holding back they are aggressive and bite and hit the poor victim you can see the injuries on the monkey after the fight he has an open wound on his arm this monkey seems to be eating this baby monkey but the little monkey manages to escape and swim further out into the water the only problem is the horde of monkeys is following his every move and this little guy will eventually have to get out of the water so it doesn't look good number six baboon versus leopard when a leopard attempts to hunt a baboon in a tree the baboon nearly kills the leopard baboons have a reputation for being aggressive and defensive when they meet a leopard even if the leopard is not attempting to pursue them in fact leopards have been known to be killed when baboons are swarming in numbers in this video the leopard survives and learns an important lesson about baboon hunting namely that they should be hunted at night because baboons have poor eyesight leopards can see six times better at night than baboons this leopard can't even get to the beach for a little relaxation when the trooper baboons immediately attack the leopard and the big cat has no other choice but to flee as fast as possible a cheetah or leopard cub has been abducted by this baboon it's impossible to tell which one it is because the baboon has it wrapped under its arms and we can't see it very well number five baboon versus impala this fawn was taken from its mother by a baboon and the baboon is holding the fawn on a rock high enough to protect itself from the fawn's mother at this point the baboon is unconcerned about the mother and continues to eat the fawn baboons are vegetarians for the most of the year but that doesn't stop them from hunting impala like the baboon in this video the baboon chases and bites this small impala while it is still alive even after the baboon has torn off nearly half of its body the poor little prey is still alive this mother impala seeks revenge after these baboons killed her fawn the killing of the fawn is not in the clip but you can just imagine how heartbroken this poor mom is and now she's trying to get even by chasing after the baboons this time a baboon captures a fawn and even bites some flesh off its back the font's mother charges the baboon who repels the mother by stretching out his arm and putting his hand in her face unfortunately the mother is powerless to save her child from the clutches of this baboon number 4 baboon vs lion we've all seen baboons act violently when they're threatened and they don't back down they operate together as a team and will face lions if they have no other option an adult baboon on the other hand is perched high in a tree clutching a lion cub i'm curious if that baboon revealed to the cub how cruel its parents are and how they wouldn't hesitate to devour baboon or if the baboon is promising the baby it will look after it the cub is small and vulnerable the baboon does not appear to be harming it another baboon comes over to assess the situation before departing the baboon walks a little with the cub in its arms before starting the grooming process thus it appears that the youngster is getting a day at the spa as part of this package after climbing a bit higher in the tree the baboon decides to descend to the ground still holding the youngster in its arms as we hear the cub lamenting itself once on the ground the baboon simply scampers away with the cup and we don't see them again baboons are tough but they're not supposed to be able to challenge a lion however in this video this young lion tries to assault a baboon and the baboon chases the lion even when the lion comes for a second wave of attacks baboon stands his ground and challenges the lion unfortunately for the baboon he was too ambitious and when the rest of the pride comes running the baboon is ambushed and has nowhere to go and it is all over for him but that doesn't matter the clip still shows that the baboon stood up to one line when the pride wasn't around and that's an incredible achievement number three baboon versus crocodile a troop by baboons can take on a huge cat if they organize themselves but i'm not sure how well they'd fear against a crocodile in the water this video demonstrates how a group of baboons can destroy a smaller crocodile not all the baboons are brave enough to leap over the crocodile at once but a few are braver than the others and once they do the rest join in the frenzy the following video shows a baboon fighting for its life and the jaws of a crocodile i have to say the baboon strength is astounding especially considering the crocodile's great jaw pressure the poor baboon manages to flee but it appears it is suffering from terrible injuries and there were no hospitals in the area number two baboon versus cheetah if there is one cat a trupa baboons can challenge it's the cheetah these baboons do not back down from a coalition of cheetahs and although the cats could probably take a baboon one-on-one these cheetahs are careful and vigilance things heat up but the conflict lasts only minutes before things get back to normal the cheetah retreat only makes the baboons more confident and more aggressive the troupe is taking no chance with the cheetahs it's not about turf it's about security and the safety of their young when baboons work together they can become very dangerous this troupe of baboons chase away a cheetah that was trying to make a kill the baboons gang up on the cheetah which is not a big cat so it doesn't hesitate to flee number one baboon battles this baboon chases all the other baboons to show he means business and he wants to rule he finally chooses a victim a female he attacks her on a tree branch and tries to make her fall to the ground but she holds on to dear life with all her strength by the time he is done there's no doubt about his intentions there will be other casualties before the day is through a younger baboon challenges the alpha male's rank so he can rule the troop with each encounter the challenger enters his way up the male hierarchy until he is second only to the alpha male most of the baboons here are trying to kidnap one of the baby baboons but the baby moves away and mom looks out for her young and defends him against the kidnappers this sentry notices an intruder entering his territory and he immediately chases him out of there baboons are territorial and work together to keep trespassers away i must say i was shocked by the violence many of these chips demonstrated every time i see a chimp it looks so friendly but i guess they have their moments as well which one was

Title: b'Brutal Hunting Moments By Chimpanzees, Baboons And Macaques'
Channel: b'The Fanatic'
Transcript: chimps are extremely strong and baboons can become incredibly abrasive both are territorial and have a hierarchical system in place have you ever seen battles between chimps what about baboons taking on chimps if you want to immerse yourself in the amazing world of chimps and baboons keep watching as we look at brutal hunting moments by chimpanzees baboons and macaques number 15 chimp versus duck in chester zoo a mother duck under 12 ducklings water into the chimpanzee enclosure the chimpanzees go crazy throwing fits at least one chimpanzee attacked another for killing a duckling and threw the mother duck into the air while other ducklings were grabbed and most likely squashed number 14 chimps kill squirrel a squirrel is chased by four chimpanzees at the san francisco zoo for a while they play around with it after that one of the chimps barely bends over bites and kills it then again he hasn't finished either he holds the squirrel up to the crowd and shows it off i guess he figures he might as well put on a good show for humans if he's going to be their source of entertainment at the oregon zoo this poor squirrel is being tossed by this chimp as everywhere a pizza being flipped in a restaurant the squirrel is flattened and killed in no time number chimp vs chimp a power struggle is going on between these chimps as some of them try to impose their rules the chimps chase and harass one another and it's not clear what's going on except for the fact there's a lot of confusion and commotion according to research this chimp's death was not a surprise the gympie was slain was the former leader of the senegalese savannah colony he was the alpha for two years before being overtaken by younger males and spending five years in exile he had tried for years to rejoin the group but was slain in the process members of his previous gang can be seen groping biting and assaulting the body in this photo at one point a member of the group attempts to wake up the dead chimp by moving its body researchers who have been studying the group for almost a decade bury the body after observing their behavior chimpanzee homicides within one social group are known to happen but there have only been a few hundred documented cases this alpha male is attacked by members of its group as they gang up on him the chimp has his back turn to them most of the time and is the victim of numerous attacks this adult chimp has snatched a baby chimp and has climbed the tree and is beating the poor baby chimp other chimps are trying to prevent it from doing so but the chimp pushes them around i guess he's the new dominant male and is killing the previous dominant male's offspring these chimps are picking on one of their own and they're not going at it lightly they're violent and relentless i don't know what this chimp did but he isn't welcome around this group number 12 chimps attack raccoon zoos demonstrate both the beauty and cruelty of the animal kingdom raccoon became trapped in the chimp cage at the saint louis zoo and was unable to escape the chimps were harassing the intruder throwing it around and sending it flying initially the chimps around and pursued the defenseless raccoon as it attempted to flee the raccoon dashed across a large boulder narrowly avoiding the grasp of the primates one monkey on the other hand grabbed its tail and threw it across the enclosure another chimp caught the raccoon by the tail as it attempted to flee through a drainpipe someone speculated the raccoon's head got stuck in the drainpipe it is possible that this is how it got in another chimp began punching the raccoon when it was defenseless what a shame allow it to leave allow it to pass some people found the racoon fight amusing i'm not sure if that was intended to be humorous because seeing a living creature in distress even if it's a pest like a raccoon is never enjoyable raccoons are notorious for sticking their noses where they don't belong with the following results the chimps gave the raccoon a piece of their mind because it had not been invited to their enclosure number 11 chimp attack humans this chimp goes bananas and attacks this man you can hear the chimp yellow set of these afternoon while its handler is trying to take control of the situation chimps are extremely strong the handler finally manages to get the situation under control all that chimp wanted was a small cup of hagen dot's ice cream a chimpanzee escaped from its enclosure in hi-fi wildlife park in east china and was captured by police a group of visitors can be seen running through the park's gates as the escaped chimpanzees pursue them observe the chimpanzees attack on this man and you'll get an idea of just how powerful a chimpanzee is this is an incredible display of strength and power and it kicks the man onto the floor without even trying too hard number 10 chimps attack monkey our thumbnail shows a chimp biting into the arm of this dead monkey the chimp has already torn the arm open and is chewing on the muscles and tendons these chimps are on the lookout for the callabas monkey one of their favorite foods the male columbus attempts to scare the chimps away even though he isn't much bigger than they are he fearlessly continues and shouts out to the rest of the team reinforcements arrive and they intend to complete the task the whole family gets involved in the hunts the catch is excellent and there is plenty of meat to go around a community-wide hunt like this brings members of the family closer together there is a lot of action hype in the trees as this chimp is looking for food the little monkeys panic and for good reason when a chimp snatches one of them up gyms have sharp teeth but to kill prey chimps hit their prey with lethal force against a hard surface they are extremely strong so a small monkey like the one in this video has no chance of surviving it's incredible to see how aggressive chimps can be you can see this chimp digging into this dead monkey chimps are not the friendly vegetarians we were told they were they do eat a diet mostly made up of fruits but it's obvious they are omnivores and will eat other animals number nine chimp versus baboon this chimp has discovered several juvenile baboons with whom to play this level of closeness complete with teasing and laughter is quite rare in the wild between such dissimilar creatures the chimp's mother isn't overprotective but she does keep an eye on her child in case he gets into mischief which he appears determined to do so he's chosen a huge monkey who refuses to participate in the game that is sufficient for the mother he calls her oldest who is tormenting the giant baboon after picking up her youngest the mother scares the baboon away with a well-aimed rock the angry baboon reappears a few minutes later and assaults a young mother the baboon undoubtably detects this female lacks the confidence of the other mother and continues to torment her she finally succeeds in chasing the monkey away a baboon is harassing these two chimps and one of them seeks protection from the other even when the baboon is attacked by the stronger chimp the baboon attacks the weaker chimp finally the stronger chimp chases the baboon away for good in this area baboons outnumber chimps by a factor of four the two species coexist peacefully for the most part but the baboon is a competitor for food so conflict can arise even a young chimp can intimidate a full-grown baboon because he has the intelligence to use a weapon the bluff works but the attacks can be very real at times the group of chimps has captured and killed a young baboon they'll gorge themselves on its remains chimps are not the gentle vegetarians that scientists thought they were but they are a formidable predator sometimes cooperating to hunt and stock their prey just like humans number eight chimp attack leopard experiments these researchers planted a fake leopard where this group of chimps could see its the leopard even moves and when the chimps see it they pick up branches and hit the leopard with rage they are so aggressive with it it's insane but one of the chimps approaches the leopard and smells it and after it senses it's fake it dismantles it and plays with its head this is one smart chimp number seven japanese macaque these monkeys attack this monkey without holding back they are aggressive and bite and hit the poor victim you can see the injuries on the monkey after the fight he has an open wound on his arm this monkey seems to be eating this baby monkey but the little monkey manages to escape and swim further out into the water the only problem is the horde of monkeys is following his every move and this little guy will eventually have to get out of the water so it doesn't look good number six baboon versus leopard when a leopard attempts to hunt a baboon in a tree the baboon nearly kills the leopard baboons have a reputation for being aggressive and defensive when they meet a leopard even if the leopard is not attempting to pursue them in fact leopards have been known to be killed when baboons are swarming in numbers in this video the leopard survives and learns an important lesson about baboon hunting namely that they should be hunted at night because baboons have poor eyesight leopards can see six times better at night than baboons this leopard can't even get to the beach for a little relaxation when the trooper baboons immediately attack the leopard and the big cat has no other choice but to flee as fast as possible a cheetah or leopard cub has been abducted by this baboon it's impossible to tell which one it is because the baboon has it wrapped under its arms and we can't see it very well number five baboon versus impala this fawn was taken from its mother by a baboon and the baboon is holding the fawn on a rock high enough to protect itself from the fawn's mother at this point the baboon is unconcerned about the mother and continues to eat the fawn baboons are vegetarians for the most of the year but that doesn't stop them from hunting impala like the baboon in this video the baboon chases and bites this small impala while it is still alive even after the baboon has torn off nearly half of its body the poor little prey is still alive this mother impala seeks revenge after these baboons killed her fawn the killing of the fawn is not in the clip but you can just imagine how heartbroken this poor mom is and now she's trying to get even by chasing after the baboons this time a baboon captures a fawn and even bites some flesh off its back the font's mother charges the baboon who repels the mother by stretching out his arm and putting his hand in her face unfortunately the mother is powerless to save her child from the clutches of this baboon number 4 baboon vs lion we've all seen baboons act violently when they're threatened and they don't back down they operate together as a team and will face lions if they have no other option an adult baboon on the other hand is perched high in a tree clutching a lion cub i'm curious if that baboon revealed to the cub how cruel its parents are and how they wouldn't hesitate to devour baboon or if the baboon is promising the baby it will look after it the cub is small and vulnerable the baboon does not appear to be harming it another baboon comes over to assess the situation before departing the baboon walks a little with the cub in its arms before starting the grooming process thus it appears that the youngster is getting a day at the spa as part of this package after climbing a bit higher in the tree the baboon decides to descend to the ground still holding the youngster in its arms as we hear the cub lamenting itself once on the ground the baboon simply scampers away with the cup and we don't see them again baboons are tough but they're not supposed to be able to challenge a lion however in this video this young lion tries to assault a baboon and the baboon chases the lion even when the lion comes for a second wave of attacks baboon stands his ground and challenges the lion unfortunately for the baboon he was too ambitious and when the rest of the pride comes running the baboon is ambushed and has nowhere to go and it is all over for him but that doesn't matter the clip still shows that the baboon stood up to one line when the pride wasn't around and that's an incredible achievement number three baboon versus crocodile a troop by baboons can take on a huge cat if they organize themselves but i'm not sure how well they'd fear against a crocodile in the water this video demonstrates how a group of baboons can destroy a smaller crocodile not all the baboons are brave enough to leap over the crocodile at once but a few are braver than the others and once they do the rest join in the frenzy the following video shows a baboon fighting for its life and the jaws of a crocodile i have to say the baboon strength is astounding especially considering the crocodile's great jaw pressure the poor baboon manages to flee but it appears it is suffering from terrible injuries and there were no hospitals in the area number two baboon versus cheetah if there is one cat a trupa baboons can challenge it's the cheetah these baboons do not back down from a coalition of cheetahs and although the cats could probably take a baboon one-on-one these cheetahs are careful and vigilance things heat up but the conflict lasts only minutes before things get back to normal the cheetah retreat only makes the baboons more confident and more aggressive the troupe is taking no chance with the cheetahs it's not about turf it's about security and the safety of their young when baboons work together they can become very dangerous this troupe of baboons chase away a cheetah that was trying to make a kill the baboons gang up on the cheetah which is not a big cat so it doesn't hesitate to flee number one baboon battles this baboon chases all the other baboons to show he means business and he wants to rule he finally chooses a victim a female he attacks her on a tree branch and tries to make her fall to the ground but she holds on to dear life with all her strength by the time he is done there's no doubt about his intentions there will be other casualties before the day is through a younger baboon challenges the alpha male's rank so he can rule the troop with each encounter the challenger enters his way up the male hierarchy until he is second only to the alpha male most of the baboons here are trying to kidnap one of the baby baboons but the baby moves away and mom looks out for her young and defends him against the kidnappers this sentry notices an intruder entering his territory and he immediately chases him out of there baboons are territorial and work together to keep trespassers away i must say i was shocked by the violence many of these chips demonstrated every time i see a chimp it looks so friendly but i guess they have their moments as well which one was your favorite why don't you let us know in the comments below well that's her look at brutal hunting

to save the girl but they are stopped by atsushi who has elected himself as the leader of that group mitsumi manages to convince them to rescue chateaus by remembering that the girl's cell phone was waterproof so even without a signal it was possible to use the GPS to check the location where they were that way mitsumi would be able to predict which insects would be inhabiting that Island which increases the group's chances of survival so they head towards the wasp's nest where mitsumi believes her friend has been taken and will likely serve as a receptacle for the insect's eggs they find a house in the middle of the bushes which was being used as a nest by the giant wasps the group enters the house in after searching the rooms mitsumi is faced with a situation capable of making her nauseous her classmates are being eaten alive by wasp larva they are being kept alive until the larva finish feeding on their innards and since those monsters release substances that give pleasure to their victims the students have not tried to escape at Sushi and jinno seeing that monster scene began to exterminate The larva seconds later the young people being eaten started screaming in pain and despair as The larva were killed they were no longer given pain inhibiting substances they run out of that place and none of them manage to stay there after hearing their colleagues death screens but mitsumi doesn't give up she still wants to look at the other nests and continue on the mission to find her friend chateaus outside the house the students spot a new wasp carrying its prey this time Akira at Sushi's friend was captured the boy runs to rescue his friend and the WASP turns around and tries to attack atsushi who is saved by mitsumi the insect heads towards its nest carrying Akira and atsushi takes a powerful and lethal pipe and goes after it there he even finds his friend but what the boy didn't count on was that the giant wasp would be waiting for him he manages to fend off the attack and falls to the first floor where he finds mitsumi the girl sprays the animal with hairspray but apparently the effect is temporary they managed to outwit the wasp and atsushi rescues Akira in that same nest mitsumi finds chateaus the girl is unconscious and mitsumi cannot carry her alone she then asks at sushi for help but the boy just cowardly takes his friend and leaves on the way out he encounters another insect and still manages to escape through the hole in the wooden floor the WASP heads towards the girls mitsumi struggles to carry her friend to a passage where they could Escape as they are about to be caught another wasp appears and attacks the animal that mitsumi had sprayed hair on just then matsuoka appears and rescues the girls the house is taken over by wasps that were attracted by the smell of the spray now they need to find serum to give to their friends who have been infected with wasp Venom Kai finds a map of the island which shows that there is a hospital nearby everything looked perfect they walked towards the place but on the way they encounter a new setback mommy spots a huge tick on jinno's back mitsumi manages to get it out but it might be too late the girl has already been bitten according to mitsumi a bite from that tick can cause a viral infection and kill her as if the situation wasn't bad enough they ended up in a tick Nest the creatures took over the whole place in a single tree you can find dozens of them with their red and scary eyes mitsumi instructs colleagues to fold their arms hide their hands and bend over to avoid Rising body temperature and releasing carbon dioxide that way they could get out of there undetected by those monsters mitsumi throws a stone heated with her body heat to attract them and the group is able to follow their way from time to time the girl throws a new heated Stone to get away from ticks as they are about to leave that deadly Nest the students meet their teacher the woman looks like a zombie and her face is taken over by those creatures the scene is disturbing Mommy despairs to see her Sensei like that and runs through the forest mitsumi has the idea of using the teacher as bait after all the woman could no longer survive she knocks her down with a piece of wood and thousands of ticks take over her body now that the insects have been attracted they will only have one chance to escape fortunately they were able to make it out alive but the teacher was not so lucky at a certain time during the night the group arrives at the hospital where they find serum vials to give to their infected friend a strange creature appears walking under Akira's skin has he been contaminated with some kind of parasite while investigating the building Kai finds the power room and manages to turn on the hospital's lights he also finds emergency supplies and takes it to his colleagues the group intends to remain there for another two days until rescue arrives when the situation seemed to be under control Akira wakes up the boy begins to struggle and his eyes take on a bizarre look his orbits pop out and Akira completely loses control of his body he runs madly out of the hospital and up to the end of the helipad where helicopters take off and land atsushi goes after his friend even though mitsumi warns him that he is infected with a deadly parasite when he reaches the top of the helipad the boy starts making loud noises that ended up attracting Predators mitsumi asks his colleagues to enter the hospital but before they can go anywhere an insect with giant wings and Claws appears he goes towards Akira and brutally kills the boy cutting off his head the boy's body falls in front of atsushi who is devastated by what just happened jinno pulls at Sushi and they both run towards the hospital behind them are the rest of the group The couple arrives at the building first and after entering jinno locks the door mitsumi asks the girl to let them in but she refuses jinno's excuse was that the classmates could also be infected with the parasite but we all know that the traitor locked the door simply to let the girls die the giant insect did not give up on attacking the girls the monster throws something at Mammy's face and when the girl turns to look at what it is she comes across Akira's head inside the hospital chateaus is waking up but still not able to move her body atsushi is still upset the boy cannot accept his friend's death chateaus asks Gino where mitsumi is and the girl says that her classmates were eaten by bugs of course she doesn't believe this story and starts calling for her friend just then she hears mitsumi screams outside jinno and atsushi intended to take advantage of chitose's immobility to do terrible things to her but luckily for the student Kai appears in the two delinquents down hitting their heads with a fire extinguisher mitsumi matsuoka and Mommy were still outside the hospital when they were about to be captured the boy opens the door and the girls are saved they try to come up with a new plan to get rid of that bizarre creature that was still looking for them outside the building mitsumi sets a risky strategy to save her friends and asks for Kai's help the girl wants to attract the attention of the giant insect using the halogen lights on the helipad she manages to get out of the building and go up the tower without drawing the monster's attention upstairs she wraps a tarp around the lights gets down the tower and using a sound alarm inside her bag she catches the insect's attention her objective is to attract it directly to the top of the helipad mitsumi tries to dodge the brutal attacks of that immense wasp that destroys parts of the building with each attack finally she manages to reach the base of the tower the girl pulls the Rope to remove the tarp and the animal is drawn to the lights when the insect lands on the tower Kai increases the power of the lights causing a a short circuit the creature is electrocuted and dies immediately due to mitsumi's plan the students managed to survive their first day on the island at dawn they make their way to another safer place if they remain there they run serious risks of being attacked by other insects as deserved Geno and atsushi are abandoned by their colleagues and left behind and under chateausa's new leadership the students set off
