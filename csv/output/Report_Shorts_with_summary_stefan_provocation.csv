In the Septuagint, the word was used as an equivalent for a Hebrew word that can be translated “meek” or “humble.” It was used with reference to Moses (Numbers 12:3), those who are teachable (Psalm 25:9), those who will possess the earth (Psalm 37:11), and the Messiah. (Matthew 21:5) Jesus described himself as a mild-tempered, or meek person. (Matthew 11:29)', 'You could get even more &quot;pages per line&quot; for Dante&#39;s Divina Commedia and its meaning and interpretation, I am pretty sure you would agree.', 'Pretty sure the saying is the weak shall inherit the earth which I&#39;m guessing and maybe I&#39;m wrong but by inherit the earth means die and put in the soil aka earth', 'Quite simple, really . Those who have swords &amp;  know how to use them but keep them sheathed will inherit the world . Don&#39;t draw your sword , though shall not kill ! Speaks volumes, doesn&#39;t it ! ❤❤❤', 'i dunno dude, thats ALOT of added text to one line of an already 9 line long passage. unless each line is simmilary poorly translated this sticks out way too much. <br><br>its much more likely that while meek is a poor translation it refers to a simple &quot;those who do not have power&quot; since the lines preceeding it call to those &quot;poor in spirit&quot; which could be seen as those who sin and those &quot;who mourn&quot;<br><br>when you take the context of the passage it becomes clear it does not exalt any attribute but rather tells that the regular people of the world will forvever recieve the love of god in his many variations of gifts (the kingdom of heaven for the poor of spirit and comfort for the mourners&quot;<br><br>too many passages of the bible are left out and forgotten because they cannot be easily used to make a point or to present an amalgamation of interpretations', 'Listen to the bible on the commentary.']

","      Espen Johan's YouTube Short ""#JordanPetersonITHeightenDesiretoBeProvocative"" shares insight from clinical psychologist and author Jordan Peterson on the effect of Twitter on human behavior. Over 102 seconds, Peterson voices concern over Twitter's influence, observing its capacity to heighten provocative tendencies.
