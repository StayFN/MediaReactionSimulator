","In this YouTube short, a man introduces his coworker, Ellie, as his ""work wife."" Ellie is surprised and confused, as she had no idea he was married. The man explains that they have a ""work marriage"" and shows her their ""work marriage license."" Ellie is still skeptical and asks questions about their relationship, such as how they met and whether they have children. The man reveals that they have a ""work son"" and shows her a child's drawing on the fridge. The conversation becomes increasingly absurd as the man talks about their ""work mortgage"" and how they've been ""work-banging"" for years. The video ends with the man saying he has other ""wives"" in different locations. The atmosphere is lighthearted and comedic, with a fast-paced exchange of dialogue between the two characters."

The comments section shows mixed reactions, with some agreeing that a degree is necessary for certain fields, while others believe that self-teaching and real-world experience are more valuable.

","Sure! Here is a 100-word summary of the YouTube short ""benjoy the light"" by NileBlue:

In this video, the creator demonstrates how to make a light bulb work using a unique method involving a vacuum pump and a container filled with nitrogen. The video starts with the creator trying to screw in a light bulb into a socket, but it keeps burning out. He then introduces his ""special machine,"" which he uses to replace the air inside the light bulb with nitrogen. After successfully turning on the light bulb using this method, the creator simply states, ""Now what? I don't know, we just enjoy the light."" The video ends with the light bulb still turned on, emitting a warm glow. The overall atmosphere of the video is calm and informative, with a touch of humor. The pace is slow and deliberate, allowing the viewer to follow along with the creator's process. Important events in the video include the initial failure of the light bulb, the introduction of the special machine, and the successful turning on of the light bulb using nitrogen."
